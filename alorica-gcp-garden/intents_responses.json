On average ENERGY STAR-certified buildings and plants use 35 percent less energy cause 35 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions and are less expensive to operate than their peers—all without sacrificing performance or comfort. Over the next year Alorica plans to certify additional sites and will perform energy audits at several of their buildings to ensure ongoing compliance and achievement of targets. Alorica’s building in St. Joseph received an ENERGY STAR score of 83 making it the most efficient Alorica building in North America. In April 2022 St. Joseph completed its light emitting diode (LED) retrofit project resulting in annual electrical savings of $50000 and energy reduction of 515000 kWh an equivalent to CO2 emissions from 41068 gallons of gas consumed. Alorica’s Corpus Christi site received an ENERGY STAR score of 80 thanks to its installation of LED lighting and energy-efficient HVAC units. “I’m extremely proud of this recognition as we expand our presence in North America” said Jay King President of Alorica’s North America Operations. “It represents our company-wide commitment to sustainability as part of our ESG initiatives. I applaud our energy management team for their continued focus on ensuring efficient operations that conserve energy while reducing costs. Taking care of one another and prioritizing sustainability efforts are equally important and this is just one of the ways we show our dedication to our people and communities both today and for future generations.” “Improving the energy efficiency of our nation’s buildings is critical to protecting our environment” said Cindy Jacobs Chief of the ENERGY STAR Commercial & Industrial Branch. “From the boiler room to the board room organizations are leading the way by making their buildings more efficient and earning EPA’s ENERGY STAR certification.\" Alorica’s ESG approach (also known as CSR) is categorized under three pillars—Philanthropy People and Planet. The Planet pillar focuses on sustainability and reducing carbon footprint and waste. Alorica prohibits practices that harm ecosystems and is always looking for ways to minimize the use of natural resources while maintaining recycling programs around the world. Since 2019 the company experienced a total reduction of over 30 million kWh throughout the region due to a decrease in heating cooling and electricity consumption. Additionally it expanded its robust Work-at-Home program Alorica Anywhere to further minimize impact on the environment by significantly reducing work commutes and the usage of office supplies globally. Alorica also continues to partner with specialized vendors to properly recycle e-waste. Since 2021 the company recycled 90 tons of waste through 19 of its sites and implemented a comprehensive GREENGUARD-certified Healthy High-Performance Cleaning (HHPC) program to commit to using green earth-friendly cleaning products.

The program was created in 1992 to help businesses and individuals save energy and fight climate change. Today every ENERGY STAR label is verified by a rigorous third-party certification process. ENERGY STAR certified buildings and plants are verified to perform in the top 25 percent of buildings nationwide based on weather-normalized source energy use that considers occupancy hours of operation and other key metrics. ENERGY STAR is the only energy efficiency certification in the United States that is based on actual verified energy performance.

    "Cracking The Code A Learning Analytics Case Study": "A worldwide telecom provider was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business. We implemented an innovative learning analytics solution designed to root out agent training problems at the source. After running a pilot program the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative. Download our Cracking the Code: A Learning Analytics Case Study to learn more. DATA SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE! Speed-to-proficiency—the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully serve their customers—is a driving Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for companies looking to streamline operations. One such company—a worldwide telecom provider—was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business. THE CHALLENGE To implement an innovative learning analytics solution—designed to root out agent training problems at the source Run a pilot program the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative THE OUTCOME Eradication of agent struggles—impacting new-hire trainee proficiency 5% reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 days 6-day reduction of new-hire training time 80% knowledge retention after 1 year THE CHALLENGE An Empowered Agent Starts with Better Training. Traditionally the client’s agent training program was lengthy and costly—not to mention that agents weren’t consistently retaining all of the needed information to resolve customer billing inquiries. Enter Alorica. Our Training and Quality teams took a look at the situation and asked—how can we shorten the training process while still helping agents retain knowledge? Faster and better—it’s not an easy code to crack! But then again they don’t call us for the easy ones. THE SOLUTION A New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing ‘confidently-held misinformation’ by using an industry-leading learning analytics technology platform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period confidently-held misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention and thus the ability to better navigate customer billing queries. In short we were able to identify a problem the client didn’t even know they had—and then offer a solution that would totally change the game. THE OUTCOME We’re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business. Furthermore we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents who appreciated a novel innovative and interesting approach to their training. Overall the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency observed a decrease in risk and loss and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction—all of which led to happier agents happier customers and a happier client.",

    "Make Your Data Matter How To Transform The Customer Experience With Data Driven Insights": "It should come as no surprise that consumers’ expectations for a better customer experience are rising. Research 1 shows that 80% of people will stop doing business with a company because of a negative service experience—with 67% of consumers leaving for a competitor after only one failed interaction. To differentiate from competitors and provide exceptional customer service businesses need to transform the customer experience—but doing so requires data-driven insight into which processes are working and which are not. Customer experience analytics can provide these types of insights and drive positive transformation. The challenge however is not just in collecting the right type of data but knowing how to pull insight from it. What data points are important? Which are not? Determining the Type of Data You Need and Where to Find It Contact centers where agents interact directly with customers provide a gold mine of customer intelligence. Each interaction is an opportunity to learn more about consumers in order to improve the customer experience. Typically there are three types of data you should collect: Volume Data – Contact events are signs that something isn’t easy for customers to solve on their own. Knowing why customers contact you by what channels and with what frequency is key to understanding what the customer wants and where the stumbling blocks are. Look at average handle times rates of repeat contacts escalations and transfers to determine where there are breakdowns in the contact experience – these are the elements that may be negatively impacting your customers and your business. Behavioral and Emotional Data – This type of data measures how your agents handle each customer and how customers respond to the interaction. The data collected should include attributes such as communication and interaction skills compliance and product and procedural knowledge. Outcome Data – It’s important to be able to predict and replicate success. Outcome data tells you how frequently you are successful in meeting your business objectives once the interaction is over. For example completing a sale avoiding a cancel or gaining a high customer satisfaction rating are all positive outcomes you want to replicate. It is also critical that your data captures interactions that occur across all channels so you can connect the pieces of the journey and understand which events trigger or prevent others. Finding Insights within the Data Now that you have collected a substantial amount of customer experience data let’s discuss how to use analytics to find insights and improve the customer experience. Check out the below categories to consider when you’re looking to shake up the status quo. Anomalies – Look at places where the result deviates from the norm. These statistical anomalies can identify areas of potential breakage in the customer experience. Confluence – Identify where trends such as economic and social (e.g. consumer spending habits and mobility trends) intersect with each other. The confluence of these trends can reveal new insights or opportunities. Frustrations – Processes that result in poor outcomes higher escalation rates or frequent complaints from frontline employees can pinpoint areas where resolution may be cumbersome or ineffective. Orthodoxies – Question any beliefs or assumptions that are not supported by correlative data. “How it has always been done” is not always the most effective way nor is it the most forward-thinking approach. Extremities – Look at your outliers. Observing contacts with strongly positive outcome data compared with those in similar situations with strongly negative outcome data can help you determine what differentiates a poor outcome from a positive one. Voyages – Allow the data to build a history or timeline that you can replicate and immerse yourself in. From here you’ll be able to glean contextual insights that help you understand which sequences of events culminate in positive or negative outcomes. Analogies – What you borrow or learn from the patterns and benchmarks of your competitors and other companies can enlighten your own business processes. The discoveries you make from your customer experience analytics can inform how you coach and develop your employees how you program your interactive voice response what tools you use and how you evaluate and reward your employees and customers. Applying Insights to Drive CX Transformation To effectively apply the insights gleaned from the data to create transformation you must make it digestible and actionable for those who have the ability to make change or alter course based on the findings. This effort requires collaboration and coordination across departments. It should make the translation from “What does it say?” to “What does it mean?” so the cross-functional team can determine what to do about it. When presented in these terms the insights allow customer experience executives to not only clearly define what is going wrong (or right) but also to quantify the costs of problems—and any required solutions. In this way business decisions become easier to make and to justify and thereby speed up the transformation process and allow your business to remain competitive.

Download our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better…one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica we’re all about using disruptive using technologies in our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we’re using to change the game—and the results we’ve seen so far. MICROLEARNING 80% of our new hires are millennials—and given their average 90-second attention span we’ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging. We call this new approach microlearning—short interactive 2-10 minute videos that deliver information “just in time”—right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional “just in case” classroom learning Microlearning videos are quick to-the-point and help reduce the need for agents to sit in long 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions. In action: Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)—leading to significant cost savings for the client. GAMIFICATION Turning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun competitive events that motivate encourage and reinforce learning— that’s gamification. Through it employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance see how they stack up against other agents and earn points that are redeemable for rewards. We customize our systems to each client’s individual objective and drive agent effort from “acceptable” to “optimal” performanc with game played and reward earned. In action: Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance attrition absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It’s simple—engaged employees who receive a boost in recognition and incentives perform better. ROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA) Movies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity but they’re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant. There are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA is all about workflow computerization and these robots identify manual repetitive and rules-based processes—tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent and with complete accuracy. In action: For a major energy company robotic automation reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10% and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major telecommunications firm robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing hundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks DON’T DISS DISRUPTIVE TECH BECAUSE IT’S HERE TO STAY —AND IT’S AWESOME! CHATBOTS Job-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels and we’re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to their automated nature chatbots can handle simultaneous candidate inquiries provide real-time responses and conduct initial applicant screenings. And because they operate 24/7 we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and ultimately hire. In-action: In three months’ time we were able to interview approximately 3000 candidates compared to 966 during the same time-frame without chatbots—saving over 1200 recruiting man-hours and reducing the cost-per-hire by 84%. SPEECH ANALYTICS This new tool is leading to all kinds of ‘a-ha!’ moments. Through Speech Analytics we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information. Are customers calling about billing? Technology? Something else? How did the call go? Was it a good customer experience? What could we be doing better? In-action: Speech Analytics radically enhances our Quality Assurance model through technology. It allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better capabilities identify call trends and themes and help us create even more insanely great customer experiences.",

    "Lessons In Loyalty": "While conducting research for this blog it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective that loyalty programs are at their core focused on driving revenue but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing. A recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experience. 1 That’s why it’s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the customer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point when considering the customer experience is the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits. Consider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer experience: 1. Keep it simple and clear According to the Harvard Business Review reducing customer effort is an important part of building loyalty 2 and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do this keep these points in mind: Simple points system The most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that translate into some type of reward and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship between points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing. One way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of points the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However this system typically works best for businesses that encourage frequent short-term purchases. 3 Set a clear goal and make it easy to see progress To prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program customers must look forward to a clear-cut goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they’ll lose interest. 4 A major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of their rewards point balance and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal. Providing customers with clear and easily accessible methods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort. A recent JD & Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President’s Club were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards programs. 5 Looking at their mobile apps and how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags behind. 2. Monitor and control An excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates retention but can also help ascertain whether your customers feel that the program is too obtuse. Redemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20% and the average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward. 6 If a redemption rate falls below 14% it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for improvement. Gathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program members gather info continuously to ensure that the organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort. 3. Use data for continuous improvement Loyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits such as average transaction amount most frequently purchased items and much more. 7 This data combined with customer contact history provides organizations with the ammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases. If a customer purchased a product and experienced an issue chances are that they may experience a similar issue with a similar product. Smart businesses will use this data in concert to push proactive content to customers to reduce the likelihood of a future contact. Pretty simple right? Create a program that is easy to understand and use measure its effectiveness and use the data available to continuously improve your customers’ experience. Seem daunting? If so we’re here to help!

    "Does Generative Ai Hold The Key To Modern Cx Discover How Alorica Is Unlocking This Opportunity": "Generative AI is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more accessible to a wider audience with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard leading the charge. OpenAI’s ChatGPT set a new record for the fastest-growing consumer application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch. As a global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions Alorica is already harnessing the power of generative AI to create more personalized brand interactions. In today’s competitive business environment every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers’ needs. To deliver a positive customer experience it's essential to understand intent context and sentiment to provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly. As a Large Learning Model (LLM) generative AI is often used to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the unique ability to be trained on large datasets. By seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with comprehension of massive content repositories the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant responses that underpin chatbots virtual assistants and other AI-driven language applications in a powerful way. As an LLM generative AI is a game-changing resource for contact centers delivering CX. Its conversation-generating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power self-service bots automate email responders and produce report summarizations. While automated chat responses already help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks generative AI adds value in other areas including in-depth analysis of customer interactions. Service organizations can use it to streamline customer service interactions quickly easily and accurately saving significant time and resources. It also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior preferences and pain points using this information to adapt their products services and processes. One of the overlooked benefits of generative AI is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data such as conversations chat interactions and even operating manuals which is a significant leap forward. This means that previously \"dark data\" can now be resurrected in a meaningful way providing organizations with valuable intel that they were unable to access before. Alorica has taken the lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative AI to enhance customer satisfaction and lifetime value. For example Alorica is collaborating with Microsoft and OpenAI on several proof of concepts. Through this partnership Alorica is using ChatGPT to analyze millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client. The purpose of this initiative is to identify patterns and trends that will enable Alorica and its client to derive actionable insights with exponentially more speed agility scalability consistency and efficiency. By combining ChatGPT’s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with Alorica’s digital-first approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually the goal is to establish use cases and applications that will transform CX. Its first task is to analyze 50000 data assets from five years and produce a cohesive report in record time. ChatGPT is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly. This project will uncover every “voice of the customer” more rapidly precisely and comprehensively. Generative AI is not just a flashy new toy. It represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve. The dawn of a new era in CX technology and engagement is upon us and as an industry we’ve only just scratched the surface. For this reason (and more) Alorica is eager to be at the forefront harnessing the power of generative AI in its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experience.",

    "How To Automate Your Contact Center Without Leaving Your Employees Behind": "There’s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend that is gaining momentum and a strategy that’s important to explore. But it’s also important to remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low unemployment and high competition for talent retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don’t let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage. Instead adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize what you will be automating. That’s done by tuning into the why and how of the automation journey. 1. Make employees part of the why. Employee engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you. One of the primary reason’s employees leave a company is because they don’t feel valued or challenged. 1 A strong foundation is built when employees not only feel valued for their skills but also for their ability to communicate well focus on the real issues requiring complex problem solving and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way. Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead it’s meant to create more opportunities for them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest. 2. Answer “What’s in it for me?” Employees want to know what’s in it for them especially as fears arise about what automation means for future job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process. Make ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily and what prevents true resolution. 2 Ask what could be automated to improve the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues. Often times the largest systemic flaws are identified in these meetings. You’ll walk away with a gold mine of information and employees will feel valued trusted and most importantly heard. Fact check the feedback against repeat calls resolution rates NPS ® scores and CSAT scores to demonstrate the ROI for the investments needed to correct the issue. Then go forth to develop your action plan. Don’t forget to close the loop – use your regular meetings to share your action plan and progress ensuring it is understandable to those it will impact the most. 3. Create a passion for self-service. Keep employees excited about a self-service culture by cultivating a campaign and infrastructure with them in mind. A few easy checks will ensure you’re doing just that. Are you including hands-on classroom training on new applications with skills verification and proficiency checks? What is your strategy for ongoing training when your website app or other self-service tools are updated? Have you invested in a mobile learning lab? Are your contact center goals aligned with the move to self-service? How are you rewarding and recognizing employees for use and promotion of self-service channels? When employees understand why and how a process like automation makes both their lives and the customers’ lives easier they will be more likely to not only to adopt but to promote it.

    "Taking A Bite Out Of Churn One Customer At A Time": "As customers become more empowered to select goods and services that fit best into their lifestyle it is imperative that businesses work harder to retain the customers they have. The cost of attracting new customers continues to increase making it harder to grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It’s widely understood that it is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one—5x more!—depending on the source 1 and industry. This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score ® movement. So we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do that in such a competitive environment? Let’s break it down shall we? Listen to your customers’ needs Take the time to know your customers—really know them. Who are they? What do they really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires what’s working and what isn’t and how they feel about their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys phone marketing exit interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums. Act on the data you gather Change when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve. Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them. Provide alternative solutions where known issues exist. Proactively offer something (a discount promo item etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to provide feedback. Furthermore it’s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback—options should include human interaction (phone or chat) and self-help (IVR web or social). It’s your willingness and ability to connect with your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer—which directly impacts your ability to retain and grow your market share. Respect your customers’ time Each interaction you have with your customers should be natural organic and personalized. Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists and they are more likely to respond positively to a real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive audience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers’ needs first so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport—explain what you can and will do each step of the way. Ask questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their business let them get on with their day. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely over-solicitation of new offerings that don’t fit their needs could push them to a competitor. Stay relevant It hardly needs to be said (but we’re going to say it anyway)—it’s absolutely critical to understand your customers and your competition. The marketplace is constantly changing and what customers see and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers or solutions become available be sure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid the fate of once iconic brands 2 no longer in existence. So let’s sum it up. To reduce costly customer churn the key is to stay focused on and connected with the customers you have listen and adapt to their feedback respect their time and ensure your offers and solutions are competitively relevant.

    "Lifelong Learning Opens The Doors Of Opportunity": "Cielito Merriam Global Client Solutions Director in Longwood Florida calls herself a “lifelong learner” and credits that outlook with helping her attain her goals. The key to being a lifelong learner is to also be a lifelong listener. If you’re able to really listen you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the status quo. Working her way up in the BPO industry she started out as an agent and then was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering before she moved into client solutions. Each new opportunity was a result of learning as much as she could in every role and then pursuing the next challenge. Read her full Q&A below: Q: How have mentors made a difference in your career? A: My first office job was during college and involved filing papers. My boss was the comptroller and he went above and beyond teaching me about the business which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with them I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers. Q: Looking back did you see yourself reaching a director role? A: Yes I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward but I think in life your priorities change as you grow. When my daughter was 3 I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew my perspectives widened my leadership and listening skills improved and my priorities about life changed. Q: As a leader have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so how did you handle it and what did you learn? A: In my life and career I’ve had to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it’s because I’m female a minority my age or all of the above. Respect is earned and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business use effective communication and make fact-based recommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect. Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory? Why or why not? A: I’ve made mistakes I’ve suffered heartaches I’ve fought hard and lost battles but I can’t say I regret any of it. Every one of those things have been a learning experience building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look at the business from varied perspectives has been positive and has let me make better decisions. Q: What excites you most about what you do at Alorica? A: Technology is progressing to take over tedious activities that allow people to spend their time in areas that provide more value and to think of solutions for the future. It’s exciting and absolutely a challenge. What’s more enriching? Something that comes easily or something that you have to work hard to achieve?",
    "Team Be Nimble Team Be Quick": "Last-minute changes to the scope loomed menacingly but by hiring specialty coaches enlisting additional expert resources and reducing unnecessary service dispatches a major communications provider saved millions of dollars while observing a significant uptick in customer satisfaction. THE CHALLENGE Manage last-minute changes to program launch scope Improve Voice of the Customer performance Reduce expensive and unnecessary non-qualified service dispatches THE RESULTS Achieved highest Voice of the Customer scores by an Outsourcer Voice of the Customer scores outperformed internal domestic centers Met Glide Path Goals even with last-minute changes to scope Saved millions of dollars with service dispatch reduction Click the link above to download the full case study . THE CHALLENGE When the Scope Flew Out the Window We Swooped Into Action. A major communications provider partnered with Alorica to create an inbound customer service program for billing and general inquiries. All was going smoothly but two weeks prior to the end of new-hire training the scope of work shifted. Alorica was tasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support in order to help reduce unnecessary service dispatches. And then one week after the launch the scope increased to include upselling of ancillary products/services. Good thing we’re all about overcoming adversity THE SOLUTION Sometimes You Need Reinforcements. Changes to the scope required us to make significant investments in additional coaching and leadership resources. • Sales-After-Service Coaches who specialize in Alorica’s solutions-based selling methodology were assigned to assist agents with selling on service calls. • Business Intelligence Analysts were hired to review call recordings and compare time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide pages visited and systems accessed for specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch; the findings were forwarded with suggested coaching methods to reduce the number of costly and unnecessary service dispatches. • Voice of the Customer Coaches specializing in VOC solutions for detractors were assigned to work with agents having challenges with specific customer dissatisfaction categories And Sometimes You Need Added Bench Strength. It was critical to ensure that growth did not come at the expense of performance so Alorica made bench strength investments by enhancing Leadership Development and Succession Planning. • Early leadership assessments of all agents helped workforce planning understand the potential bench strength available for ramps • Financial incentives encouraged agents to enroll in Alorica’s “clear path” program for leadership development and leadership certifications • Systematic succession planning established that managers would be eligible for promotion only when at least two of their subordinates were certified for promotion • Peer-to-Peer “Buddy System” was founded where each role function and manager were paired up with a high-performing manager within the client’s internal contact centers Alorica drove ticket quality and ultimately minimized the expense of dispatching to the client’s customers who truly required a service truck by implementing a Ticket Quality Management group. • We hired Ticket Quality Managers as business intelligence analysts to audit calls and systems identify outliers and coach for improvements for non-qualified dispatches Pre-dispatch auditing identified Non-Qualified Dispatches prior to our client incurring the expense by reviewing call recordings and comparing time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide pages visited and systems accessed for specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch Outlier identification of the individual team (and site where the non-qualified dispatch originated) was gathered and analyzed Outlier coaching was conducted to improve behaviors and avoid future non-qualified dispatches THE OUTCOME Being Nimble and Staying Committed—That’s how We Earn a Win. The ability to react quickly to change played a major part in finding success with (and for) our client. Thanks to significant investment in additional coaching and leadership resources our partnership with the client helped to: • Exceed performance targets during and after launch • Drive improvements to service ticket quality • Minimize the expense of dispatching to customers …talk about an insanely great ending.",

    "Social Care Analytics And The Retail Customer Experience": "“Know your customer” has been a retail rallying cry for the past several decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers’ likely buying behaviors they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers now face is how to enhance and personalize the customer experience so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer and the brand—regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship. But let’s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as Social Media . What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV radio and print as the preferred media source for a growing percentage of the population and as ‘cord cutters’ continue to rise advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services and are being reallocated towards content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices. As these extensive technological changes continue and growing consumer demand and the ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage it’s imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock valuable consumer data including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their experiences and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care—the efforts of caring for customers using social media—is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers. Marketers retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their customer journey by providing social media support yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and quantitative value of their efforts. Retailers are being pushed into social care by engaged social-savvy consumers who are posting questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news is that not all social posts are created equal—they don’t all require a response. Robust listening platforms along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and effective. In addition while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a customer asks a question in a channel that isn’t able to support an appropriate response. For example if a customer asks a question on Twitter the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry in 140 characters or less. For some context the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise a customer may need to share sensitive account information thus requiring a more private secure channel such as phone chat or email. Although channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered it raises problems for measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately there are technology platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues. Metrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program. Traditional social media metrics (“likes” “followers” etc.) are valuable but they don’t necessarily provide insight into important areas—like the level of customer satisfaction across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your customer retention strategy. Lastly consider partnering with your user community. It’s a good idea to deploy YouTube customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z YouTube can help you provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company’s overall support cost. Avenues for guided self-service including video FAQs and tutorials provide a path of great value for your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome—higher satisfaction levels for all customers and a more strategic deployment of internal resources—both of which can impact your bottom and top lines. Today’s retailers stand at a crossroads—evolve existing practices to meet and exceed the expectations of your customers or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you in the marketplace. Don’t let customers pass you by—start planning your social care channel redirection and guided self-service strategy today—because your success depends on it!",

    "The Wait Is Over Live Chat Delivers Immediate Assistance And Drives Business Growth": "For decades companies have relied on partnerships with contact center outsourcing providers to handle customer questions and resolve issues quickly—but the times they are a changin’. As the tidal shift toward digital non-voice methods of communication continues no channel has resonated more strongly with customers than live chat; in fact a recent report found that demand for live chat features on company websites grew by 8.3% in 2017 . 1 Live chat allows businesses to connect in real-time with visitors on their website. This robust channel meets online users where they are providing instant assistance while the customer is immersed in that online ecosystem. The ability to get information quickly without leaving the keyboard is a key benefit; of those who utilize Live Chat 79% do so because of the efficient nature of the platform . 2 In fact chat has the highest satisfaction rating among all customer service channels with 73% of online consumers giving it the thumbs up . 3 Why so beloved? Here are four great reasons why customers embrace this customer service channel. #1: More convenient than drive-thru coffee Average customer wait times are generally much shorter in live chat than when calling in to a support line and customers can multitask while waiting for a response. The average response time is 2 minutes and 40 seconds with the fastest response time being 7 seconds 4 —compared to nearly 7 minutes of wait time when calling in to a contact center . 5 #2: More connected than an Instagram Influencer Customer service reps using Live Chat can co-browse (view a customer’s screen); this lets them see in real-time what they need to in order to troubleshoot the customer’s online issues with speed and efficiency . 6 #3: More accurate than a laser-guided missile Live chat makes it easy for agents and customers to share SKU numbers general account information confirmation codes and other important textual data—reducing the likelihood of errors. #4: More proactive than a devoted butler Live Chat lets agents serve up special offers to loyal customers or offer assistance; meanwhile a live preview of what the customer is typing provides agents with in-depth insights— before the customer has even finished typing ! 6 Research shows that customers are as equally receptive to chat as a marketing tool as they are to use it for online support and chat has been shown to drive customer loyalty. Consider these facts: 44% of online consumers 7 say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer. 79% of customers say they prefer live chat purely because of the immediacy it offers compared to other channels. 8 63% of consumers say 9 they are more likely to make another purchase from a website that offers live chat. Live chat offers several benefits to e-commerce businesses and other companies. Online support tools enable the capture of valuable consumer data—such as last page viewed and common questions—that can reveal opportunities to improve the user experience. In addition agents’ ability to handle multiple conversations simultaneously can reduce average interaction costs. Equally important offering live chat can increase conversion rates and reduce abandonment since 77% of customers won’t make a purchase on a website if there’s no live chat option available . 10 Chat is increasingly relevant and valuable as a support and sales channel; not only does it enhance the customer journey (leading to increased efficiencies and streamlined handling) it provides an opportunity to maximize the customer experience by engaging visitors who might otherwise have left your website without making a purchase or ever asking for help . And that’s something worth talking about. SOURCES",

    "Mlba Fundraisers Our Worst 3 Omaha 06": "by J. Scott Nebel Omaha 06 While any fundraising event that engages unifies and raises money is a worthy effort fundraising is not without its failures and frustrations. So here is ... Part 2 ( click here for Part 1 ): What Went Wrong…? (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers) Flop Number 3: Car Wash Hose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash only we're not really washing anything so it's more of a \"_\" which I really don't know how to pronounce but I'm pretty sure a \"_\" doesn't make any money! We have succeeded and failed with car washes but failure was always a result of the planning and execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes: TIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule more than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick be pulled into emergency meetings or get abducted by aliens (Seriously it's been weeks. Where's Joe!) TIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President of Corporate Suds and Towels we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out how much staff you will need. Flop Number 2: Off-Site Events Off-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work getting the name Alorica out into the community—it's a win-win even if you make nothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ... TIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop. Whether we had 10 people show or 100 we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either but that's still marginally in the \"win\" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the Penny War ...) TIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion but ensure you have active engagement across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of a full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my first attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!) Number 1: Culture Kitchen \"Wait didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?\" Yup. \"Are you losing your mind or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?\" Yup. Pricing is a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead establish a foolproof plan. TIP1: I \"math-ed\" and you can too! Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing: 2c/p aka Two times the C ost of the food divided by the anticipated number of P articipants. TIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation? Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball or a time-traveling Delorian but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back in time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around 25-33% of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees (at least not when there is a charge... FREE food is a totally different animal and it's not housebroken not even a little!) You'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you try some but in general 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor or become the vendor ourselves. Oh and always round prices up … it’s easier to give change for whole dollars! To Avoid Fundraising Failures Follow our Four \"P\"s: Plan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately then execute the heck out of it!) Promote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers the emails or the dancing monkeys!) Party with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!) Peanut Butter! (Yeah I really only had three \"P\"s sorry.)

    "4 Tips To Strengthen It Customer Service Response": "While it’s important to deliver consistent client service on a regular basis it can be difficult to do so without the proper technological infrastructure. As consumer demands continue to shift customer care solutions teams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons’ needs. While these technologies create a faster more flexible staff member they also require special attention in some instances since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure. IT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a customer relationship management technology system but in terms of systematic processes finding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems they’re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction among other things. With that in mind here are four tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue: 1. Don’t jump to conclusions: Assuming typically doesn’t get anyone very far so best practice – especially in the customer service industry – is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It can be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business’s service center especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before. However the idea of effective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on. 2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process: The parlance of a BPO technical support representative will likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It’s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The way a client describes something may make sense to him or her but it very well could be the wrong way to describe something from a business standpoint. Alternatively a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron otherwise the internal vernacular may confuse the customer at hand. 3. Manage issues in order of their importance: In a perfect world nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team’s IT infrastructure therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However since the human element is a constant in the client services equation there are bound to be mistakes in the process. As a result management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively or else the most important issues won’t get taken care of first. 4. Cover all bases before taking action: This can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion so it’s hard not to understand why a contact center service would want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet it’s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts with the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a longer process but it will teach reps to double-check cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed.",

    "Alorica Cmo Talks About The Feedback Economy": "How to Leverage the Feedback Economy to Provide Insanely Great Customer Service Shep Hyken interviews Colson Hillier Chief Marketing Officer of Alorica. They discuss the feedback economy and how to leverage customer feedback to improve the customer experience LISTEN TO PODCAST Top Takeaways: Companies spend billions of dollars building their brands retail stores and products. But when it comes down to the moment that’s most impactful for a customer it usually comes down to their interaction with a customer service agent. The feedback economy shifts the service model on its head. There is less focus on broadcasting why your company is great. The focus is on listening to the customer understanding their pain points and creating more systemic changes to address them. There are thousands of avenues for empowered consumers to make their voices heard. You need the right tools to harness all this feedback and take action. Social channels don’t discriminate. Companies have to learn to change their processes technologies and products to be responsive. The customers need to be the center of a company’s strategy. Technology is only a piece of what it takes to get the customer service equation right. You need the right judgment and empathy to take action and help your customers. Customer service happens throughout the entire customer journey. The overall user experience is a function of an ecosystem of partners for delivery. Employees and in some instances companies need to collaborate to create a great customer experience . Policies should be rules or guidelines that empower employees to help the customer instead of hindering service. Quotes: “The customer is the center of everything that you do.” “Always put the customer and their voice as your north star in how you think about providing service.” “At the end of the day it comes down to listening. Leverage your socials and content reviews as business assets.” “Customer feedback is your biggest resource. The customer can guide you to your success.” About: Colson Hillier is the Chief Marketing Officer for Alorica. He oversees the planning development and execution of Alorica’s marketing and communications strategy as well as initiatives tied to the company’s brand principles value proposition and revenue growth. Shep Hyken is a customer service and experience expert New York Times bestselling author award-winning keynote speaker and your host of Amazing Business Radio. This episode of Amazing Business Radio with Shep Hyken answers the following questions … and more: How do you empower customer service agents? What is the feedback economy?

    "How Do Analytics Factor Into Acquiring Retaining Customers": "The Importance of Acquisition and Retention Let’s start with a couple facts. It’s been shown that: A 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25% Brand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers and 7x more than detractors Companies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passive The truth is many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what’s the solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers but maintaining the customer relationships you already possess? Simple. Analytics. It’s Good to Get Analytical. Analytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at the right time increase your propensity to connect convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand. In addition analytics let companies personalize the customer experience reducing the need for mass sales pitches or blanket selling. Our extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day lead demographics and scoring bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And yet analytics are practically useless unless you can truly put them to work. Actionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters The sad truth is that analytics are often only reported and not analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities as potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics). But it doesn’t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists predict propensity to connect and increase first-attempt connects all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%. The Bottom Line Access to analytics is important but analyzing the analytics – putting the data to work for you – that’s where the difference is made. It’s all about predictive models that leverage diverse sources of data such as text survey responses and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households which when coupled with Alorica’s 30 years of experience allows us to fully analyze and interpret information – and not just merely spit out numbers. That’s how you gain customers. That’s how you keep customers. Simply put that’s what grows your company. And growing your company is what Alorica is all about.",

    "Want To Recruit Millennials Ignite Your Employer Brand": "Are Millennials from Mars? There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain this group–which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone–that one begins to wonder if they’re from another planet. While understanding and decoding this group is paramount there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them. 1 The most important weapon is your employer brand. What is an employer brand…and why should you care? As a textbook definition your employer brand is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about you. At its core though your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes. 2 It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And when all of those people get together what is the working environment and culture like? The employer brand and employee value proposition have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more choices than ever before. 3 So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they’ve decided that they won’t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact in one study almost 70% of candidates said they wouldn’t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation even if they were unemployed. 4 So how do you create a great employer brand? Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It’s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time. Key component #1: Take time for self-reflection Every company has an identity. It will typically include elements of your brand’s purpose your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What’s important to your company your CEO your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to have)? Is yours a company where people actually want to work? Why or why not? This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core elements of your company warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this. Key component #2: Authenticity above all else Candidates–particularly millennials–hate liars. Don’t try to be something you’re not. The whole point of this exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a quality match there. As you develop your employer brand stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that. Key component #3: Develop a purpose-driven EVP Your Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers and their supervisors; engagement; authentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that? Key component #4: Become a great storyteller You have a great employer brand and compelling EVP but don’t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong. In the real world “if you build it” people will not come. You need to become a great storyteller to capture the attention of millennials and bring them to you. There’s a “secret sauce” for how do this and of course it helps if your employer brand’s voice and creative designs appeal to your target candidates. 5 But make sure your designs reflect your company too (see point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready include them in all components of your talent acquisition strategies and engage millennials where they congregate (e.g. social media). As companies fish in the same millennial talent pool it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer brand you can do just that. SOURCES 1.

    "Its All About Making An Impact": "Alorica delivers customer service on behalf of the world’s largest and most respected brands but we are so much more than a leading CX provider. We are a company of people a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility is to ensure that every Alorican is engaged inspired and nurtured to succeed. As Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer I don’t take this responsibility lightly. And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless. Be True . With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work full-time from our homes these values have taken on an even greater significance. They’ve kept us united even as we physically work apart and we’ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many essential businesses—including contact tracing food delivery and content moderation. As a minority-owned business Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities. It’s why we stand up for those less fortunate and it’s what led us to launch TIDE: Together for Inclusion Diversity & Equity . We’ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them. We’ve facilitated respectful fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism bias sexual and gender identity mental health and more. And through them all we’ve learned about our people. We’ve listened to their stories. And we’ve grown—together. We take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit partner Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) has supported team members around the world in times of crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities—and to-date we’ve given out almost $5M in grants in six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities—supporting causes and individuals in need. All of these programs are certainly good for the soul—but are they good for the business? In one emphatic word YES! Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have had a tremendous effect on Alorica’s ability to hire and retain top talent. We’re committed to Impact Sourcing—through which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities. Giving people the chance to earn a living support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it’s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing—and so what’s good for the community is also good for the bottom line. And it’s not just our people that care about our efforts—our partners do too! Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR and they want to team up with like-minded corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility align great partnerships are forged—and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible relationships based on shared values. Being insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible and it’s an honor to lead Alorica’s efforts in serving the common good. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved in a short amount of time but we’ve only just begun—and there are awesome things to come!",

Within only days we’ve successfully transitioned thousands of agents to an at-home environment—and more are coming online each day! We’re thrilled to take this opportunity to share new stories filled with passion performance and very long hours—and acknowledge accomplishments that truly shatter the status quo! Our entire Austin site has converted to a work-at-home environment ! And it wasn’t easy. Starting last Sunday Sr. Site Director Tony Piñon his management team and the client were on-site getting systems ready. The team then spent all of Monday and Tuesday deploying hundreds of production ABAY and support staff into the at-home environment. Tony shared that the tremendous achievement wouldn’t have been possible without everyone banding together—including the entire Austin management team all the incredible agents corporate partners and executive leadership. Next up our Honduras site was just beginning to celebrate a partnership with a brand-new client when the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 threatened to bring business to a halt. But—our team snapped into action and immediately started testing remote access by sending one agent home to log-in. When that worked they mobilized a few more agents and once they were confident in the solution they contacted the client to share the good news. The client was incredibly impressed with their proactive resolution and soon the rest of the pieces fell into place. Site leadership determined which agents in the site met the requirements to work from home launched training for the eligible employees (two weeks early in fact!) and transitioned a great number of employees to Work-from-Home. Finally we have an incredible story to share from our Newport News site! After quickly surveying their entire team to confirm who met the technology requirements to work remotely site leaders made it happen in record time—and transitioned more than a hundred employees in just a couple days!

Social media companies have found themselves particularly liable in recent years. The FTC regularly imposes multi-million dollar fines against them…and contrary to common assumptions Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act does not provide protection from being held liable for bad behaviors on their platforms 6 . And it’s not just steep fines (and the bad publicity that comes with them) that companies have to worry about—because with each incident reputations suffer. Bearing in mind that approximately one in five customers would stop shopping with retailers whose data was hacked and stolen online risks can have devastating consequences to a company’s bottom line from the largest big-box retailer to the local boutique. Trust & Safety strategies—of which content moderation is an essential tool—can help keep company information accurate and customers safe even in an ever-changing crowded online landscape. Understanding Legal and Reputational Risks (and How to Prevent Them) With so much at stake companies need to prioritize risk mitigation. And to effectively meet the expectations of consumers employees and investors that means adopting effective risk management programs based on actionable insights. But how can companies determine what their risks are let alone know how to adopt formal programs that touch every aspect of their organizations? To help guide companies towards successful risk management efforts we hosted a webinar dedicated to assessing organizational legal and reputational risks for actionable insights featuring Adam Dorfman VP of Product at Reputation.com Joe Buggy Alorica’s Head of Trust & Safety and Harry Folloder SVP Chief Digital Officer at Alorica. The spirited roundtable discussion covered a wealth of information from explaining the nuances of assessing risk and best practices to AI’s role in reputation management. Key takeaways included: Legal vs. reputational: As exemplified by Home Depot and Target legal risks can include lawsuits judgements and financial harm; reputational risks include the erosion of trust and customer losses. Proactive risk assessment : Companies that regularly conduct risk assessments can stay one step ahead; this means seeking out customer feedback versus waiting for negative content to flourish online. Active monitoring and listening to customers in real time builds trust and helps ensure that negative reputation-damaging online feedback is addressed quickly and effectively. Risk management adoption : Using frameworks helps companies decide how to approach risk management including the total number of risks percentage of organization affected how have risks been mitigated historically how many risks are monitored and how many are mitigated. And once risks are assessed have a process in place to help you plot and understand the scope each presents to the organization as a whole. Best Practices : By responding quickly to customer feedback online—within 24 hours for negative feedback and two days for positive feedback—companies show customers that they’re listening to them which positively impacts both sentiment and retention. The role of AI : While AI can be a great tool for businesses it also allows spam to proliferate; companies can circumvent potential risks by shifting to video testimonials confirmed customer prioritization or just by adding check marks to customers or purchases to add validation. Just Do Something Perhaps the biggest takeaway from our panel discussion was that when it comes to mitigating risks companies can’t sit on the sidelines. They must act—and act fast—or they’ll face serious consequences. Acting starts with companies understanding that there are external forces out there that can do serious harm to their bottom lines and tracking risks accordingly. That doesn’t have to mean creating Risk Mitigation departments—simply asking exploratory questions to identify risks and creating a spreadsheet to track them can put companies on the path to less risks and happier customers.

    "Colleen Beers Shares Career Advice And A Passion For Diversity": "Reshared from Colleen Beers’ LinkedIn It’s Women’s History Month y’all! As a mother of six wife of one and woman among millions if I can give any advice to all the ladies out there it is to lead by example. I’m so grateful to work at a company like Alorica where I’m personally encouraged to be bold and my teams run with it when I challenge them to do the same. Because after 30 years in the biz I can say with certainty that YOU are your best advocate and you have the power to make things happen for yourself. When I first started out as a call center agent in my 20’s I didn’t know it would take me to where I am today—the President of North America and Europe Operations for one of the largest digital CX providers in the world . But I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example and lead in the same way. So don’t wait for someone to come tap you. Never say “no” to a chance to learn more skills. Make mistakes learn from them and move on. As I often say “get over it.” You never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these things. Most importantly don’t follow a career path; build the one that’s meant for you. This month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias—the theme celebrated around the world for International Women’s Day. Furthering diversity and inclusion is and should be a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do it enhances our business company culture and especially our people. At Alorica we even have the numbers to prove it—our female population has grown since last year with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that but as the largest certified and award-winning minority-owned BPO we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce to 71%. Why are these facts important? Because strong representation of groups such as women and minorities matter to our employees our clients and our customers—even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as a company we are making progress. There’s much work to be done but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction. As we continue Women’s History Month I’d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change. These qualities which have sometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness actually demonstrate our strength. We aren’t afraid to show these skills with conviction strong execution and thoughtful leadership and sometimes wearing bright-red heels. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE…watch me! Read the original post at:",

    "Inclusive Culture Diverse Workforce": "As globalization continues to reshape the way businesses operate workforce is becoming increasingly more diverse bringing in a unique perspective of innovative thinking and cultural expertise. But to attract and retain this diverse talent we need to focus on creating a culture of inclusivity that encourages individuality. Here are some of the benefits of being part of a global company with an inclusive mindset. 1. Exploring new markets with confidence We are in the era where global presence has become a defining element of success. A diverse talent pool enables companies to harness the cultural knowledge of their employees thereby understanding the local nuances that are an integral part of consumer behaviors and preferences. This helps brands penetrate new markets effectively and stay ahead of anticipated risks while exploring new opportunities. Our operational footprint across NA APAC LATAM and EMEA enable us to best support our customers worldwide with #LimitlessPossibilities 2. Empowering growth Employees want to do their best work for leaders they trust and respect. An inclusive leadership team is a key selling point for recruiting best-in-class talent and boosting a company’s reputation as an employer of choice. Employees excel in their performance when they feel encouraged to be their true selves in their workplace and when they see diversity within their leadership team. Alorica is proud to be a certified diverse supplier with strong minority and female representation around the world. Last year we promoted 5000 employees globally and more than half were women. We were also specifically recognized earlier this year for our Achievement in Promoting & Developing Women. #EnhancedPerformance 3.

By providing opportunities to local employees from all walks of life—different ages ethnicities genders interests skills education—to interact with solve problems for customers and grow professionally companies have a positive ripple effect that impacts communities. This is seen through job creation economic development corporate social responsibility contributions and more. As an example as part of our skilling program in India we also hire undergraduates and offer extended skills training for career advancement. #PassionatePeople I can confidently say that one of Alorica’s top differentiators is our people and the corporate culture we’re building together. As we expand our footprint we remain committed to fostering inclusivity across the teams we support and in collaboration with our fellow colleagues around the world and by doing so we’re making our Brand Promise come true—Passion. Performance. Possibilities.",
    "Chat With Our Chatbot The Future Of Recruitment": "The Oxford dictionary defines a chatbot as 'a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users especially over the internet.' As is often the case with new technology many initial chatbots were created for fun but they’re now being used to enhance the workplace particularly in HR departments. How you ask? Job interviews can be incredibly stressful for applicants. Chatbots provide a level of comfort and ironically emotional distance that can promote efficient and relaxed conversations. Recruitment chatbots can stage initial interviews that are direct friendly and minimally intimidating. It’s also simply a better faster and easier way to connect with qualified candidates. This is a win-win for both applicants and HR teams. At Alorica we have been testing this method of recruitment in the Philippines by embedding the technology onto the Alorica Philippines Facebook page conducting screenings via Facebook Messenger. To measure the effectiveness of this method the technology had to solve the following challenges: maximize online recruiting channels; generate inactive leads; and reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads. In the span of just three months the results have already been overwhelmingly positive! During the testing period 3088 candidates were interviewed compared to 966 during the same period a year prior. There was a savings of more than 1200 recruiting man hours and the cost per hire reduced by 84 percent. Additionally online channel conversion rate was up to 14-16 percent compared to traditional channels at 4-6 percent. To sum it up chatbots have completely changed the way Alorica thinks about recruiting. By implementing the technology we have not only saved money and man hours but allowed us to connect with qualified candidates who resonated with this recruitment strategy. It just goes to show the trick to getting face time is a little screen time. Alorica is one of the biggest outsourcing employers in the region with 17 sites strategically located across metro Manila and provincial regions. If you are in the Philippines and are interested in joining our local employee base of 38500 visit the Alorica Philippines Facebook page where you can interact with our chatbot using Facebook Messenger.",

    "Hard To See No See Doctors Changing The Face Of Health Care Customer Service": "Recent health care regulations have made it difficult for sales reps and marketing personnel to meet with doctors on an individual basis. \"No-see\" and \"hard to see\" have become industry buzzwords in regards to medical practitioners since securing face time with them has become a challenge. As physicians - and fluid regulations - continue to restrict access to outside reps the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with patients and less time being solicited. According to a study by Doctors.net.uk 52 percent of the more than 1000 1 general practitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week while just 26 percent only saw one rep in the same time period. No-see doctors are impacting the medical field in a way that is negative for big pharmaceutical companies but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps they can focus more on patient health. A general lack of time was cited as the No. 1 reason why doctors don't see sales reps anymore with 38 percent of respondents saying they were too busy to meet with sales executives. Another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice policy. No-see doctors mean industry wide changes This shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry not just sales and marketing reps. Patients are beneficiaries of no-see doctors because they see more individual attention but on the other hand practices aren't able to take in as many patients as they used to hence limiting business to a certain extent. On the back end of operations doctors now have to manually enter patient information into electronic health record databases and submit prescriptions themselves so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a result according to Clark Ridge vice president of client health care services at Alorica. \"The level of accuracy receiving greater scrutiny I think you're just saying spend a little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right\" Ridge said. \"To a doctor though it's had a negative impact on their ability to generate revenue because it's reduced the number of people they're able to see.\" Ridge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies such as reimbursement rates determined by patient satisfaction scoring the trickle-down effect of no-see and hard-to-see doctors may be more wide-sweeping than first thought. No longer are general physician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long periods of time before they see a doctor. Outsourced assistance could prove useful Now that doctors are spending more time with each patient chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized experience. On the front end of doctor's office visits practices have been implementing streamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments. For example individuals can now go online and book a time to visit their physician and when they show up for their consultations they can check-in using an automated kiosk. Although the adoption of the electronic sign-in has been slow Ridge said it could greatly benefit the practices that implement such systems. \"To really take advantage of efficiency outsourcing some of that interaction to a group of individuals that don't have to be on-site and can capture the information is a much less costly alternative\" he said. \"Where completeness and accuracy are key outsourcing is a great option.\" SOURCES 1",

    "Outsourcing The Cure For What Ails Your Company": "In 2015 over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced 1 . It’s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources costs are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology tools and best practices that aren’t generally available internally. Top providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution? Read on dear friends. Read on. Six Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense 1. You want to retain customers. THE SITUATION Your current customers are happy but your business is struggling to maintain – and improve – an already exceptional level of service. THE SOLUTION Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions – chat video etc. (often platforms that have not yet been considered). 2. You want to acquire new customers. THE SITUATION Bringing in new business generates revenue but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line. THE SOLUTION While focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes – as it turns out we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent profile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind – companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see on average a 9.5% increase in annual revenue 2 . 3. Specialized training requires detailed education. THE SITUATION Certain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining and often there’s just too much for one trainer to know – but additional coaching can’t be supported by your in-house team. THE SOLUTION With a BPO company you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met. 4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal. THE SITUATION High-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don’t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional often unpredictable push. THE SOLUTION BPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively providing you with options in multiple time zones and facilitating brick-and-mortar work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions. We excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs so that you’re always staffed with the most qualified talent. 5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls. THE SITUATION As your company expands you may find yourself needing fast – and thoughtful – solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers your business simply loses the ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand. THE SOLUTION A BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return to focusing solely on the business in-house processes or other ventures. You don’t have all the tech you need. THE SITUATION It’s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel you’re missing out on opportunities to enhance customer experience and loyalty. THE SOLUTION BPOs have deep experience with analytics – going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels – voice email chat text video and social media – customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term. *** Your company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values. Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless blended partnership that benefits both sides. Reach out to us any time and let’s talk about how Alorica can make a win-win situation happen for you.

    "How Microlearning Led To A 96 Compliance Rating For A Major Retail Pharmacy Provider": "As a result of the average attention span being reduced to a mere eight seconds people today are accustomed to finding an answer from a quick search. This is where microlearning comes in – it meets this expectation of consuming information while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way of teaching and delivering content in small bursts microlearning has been a key success factor for our agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider. Managing millions of customer prescriptions daily this pharmacy provider began to experience some challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant ranging from financial loss to medication abuse and in this highly-regulated industry it was simply unacceptable. To fix the problem Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved process compliance but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it microlearning. Instead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation we implemented microlearning — where we created a customized brief 10-minute video allowing agents to understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so this helped close the culture gap to better align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program we began collecting data on the effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves – the compliance rating improved to as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving — with an average of four training hours per full-time employee. Thanks to this new training method the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore these microlearnings were cost-effective resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral salary for trainers etc.). We know your business has unique customer needs and we’re here to make sure our agents who provide customer service on your behalf are fully informed and engaged to make lives better one interaction at a time.

As part of their commitment to the patient experience OHSU sought to simplify patient billing by combining hospital and physician charges into a single streamlined statement. To launch their vision OHSU selected state-of-the-art Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology from EPIC software. THE SOLUTION Unified Rapid Response Stabilizes A/R and Improves Workflow Processes. By aligning talent from both sides OHSU and Alorica worked together to correct the impeding issues and successfully completed the conversion to EPIC. We further assisted by developing enhancements to the EPIC interface that helped maximize efficiencies and create “safety nets”—these safety nets including exception reporting identified accounts that were not moving through the self-pay workflow as expected and created a more stable environment. Enhancements included: Workflow Automation That used EPIC data fields to support outbound call campaigns and end-of-lifecycle timelines based on patient billing levels and statement dates. Reconciliation Automation That allowed recognition of returned mail payment plans and statement suppression to ensure workflows were functioning correctly. Post-conversion clean-up With Alorica resources strategically placed to accelerate recoveries and reduce A/R days. Transparent Reporting and Business Intelligence Provided regular updates to OHSU on where payments were in the lifecycle as well as helped forecast future revenue recovery rates; bad debt forecasting provided the road map to timelines needed to communicate stabilization of the post-conversion clean-up. Predictive Analytics Better identified a patient’s propensity to pay and further customized outbound efforts to improve liquidation results and patient satisfaction. Continued Efforts Further Improve Patient Experience and Workflow Processes: OHSU and Alorica continue to apply thought leadership to improving the patient experience through quarterly business intelligence reviews.

As Everest Group’s analysts observed outsourcing is more cost-effective for companies no matter the economic climate. Outsourcing Trust & Safety initiatives including content moderation and content management empowers multi-dimensional multilingual content moderation at scale—something we as a veteran BPO industry leader can easily attest to. As we’ve found by acting as an extension of a client’s business we’ve been able to provide seamless support while improving the customer experience without incurring risks for our clients. Identify the most viable shoring mix. Going offshore (and nearshore) for Trust & Safety efforts makes dollars and sense per Everest Group’s analysis. As they note even large tech firms have been shifting their content management and related needs to cost-effective locations in APAC and LATAM. In our experience by leveraging our global workforce and delivery models including work-at-home hybrid and gig workforce solutions clients can empower safe spaces online as well as maximize ROI in any economic climate. Leverage alternative talent models for non-sensitive work types within Trust & Safety. Having a diverse workforce mix makes content moderation and other Trust & Safety initiatives manageable; and as Everest Group rightly notes hybrid workforces featuring full-time and gig workers have become increasingly common in the post-Covid-19 landscape. Outsourcing optimized global workforces like Alorica’s empowers companies to safeguard online communities with ease; we also invest heavily in our employee wellbeing to ensure that our talent is always up to the task. Adopt a pragmatic approach to digital investments. Large technology firms often partner with third-party service providers to leverage their talent pools and harness new technologies. Outsourcing as Everest Group illustrates makes it possible for companies of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technologies to improve content moderation and customer support simultaneously. Alorica’s clients and their customers enjoy the latest technology and optimal support without impacting their bottom lines. But this is just the beginning per Everest Group because outsourcing Trust & Safety also helps reduce attrition creates more resilient workforces and reduces portfolio risks—all things we couldn’t agree with more.

More than 95% of the pilot site’s team was made up of Millennials and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance. Furthermore our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. Challenge accepted. THE SOLUTION Better Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores. Instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention marathons we championed microlearning : a short animated video that focused on client-specific goals (in this case the importance of improving compliance). Brief animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client expectations. THE OUTCOME Microlearning Makes Its Mark. Thanks to the new training method the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions. Furthermore microlearning is cost-effective minimizing the need for traditional classroom training and ultimately cutting development costs by 50%.",

    "The Three Secret Ingredients To A Successful Career": "Have you met Sarah Machan-De Silva? Not only is she Alorica's Asia-Pacific Chief of Staff she is the MLBA Philippines’ Program Administrator AND a member of the Board of Trustees for the Healthcare Information Management Association of the Philippines! We know you’re all wondering—how does Sarah do it?! What's her secret? Sarah credits the following: Take risks change your attitude to gratitude and build a family-like culture. Read about Sarah's insanely great professional journey below and learn how you too can change the game! Describe your background and career path I started on the phones as an agent in 2003 but knew that I really wanted to be a trainer. I applied a few times and when I finally got the opportunity it was awesome! Then with some encouragement I transitioned into operations—first as an Operations Manager—and have since been growing within the organization. What’s an example of a choice you made that you are proud of or that served as a turning point in your career? Taking risks. Too often we make ‘safe’ decisions—but the times that I have taken risks and embraced opportunities outside of my comfort zone have turned out to be game changers! Could you offer any professional advice to employees who are just starting out? Just be you. You are where you are for a reason so step up and show up! Work hard and be a good example to others. Don’t hurt others along the way be grateful and learn from the rough roads. And finally change your attitude to gratitude. What’s an example of a challenge you experienced at work? (Any due to being female?) How did you approach the problem and what were the results? Back in the day the biggest challenge I faced was not having the appropriate tools and training for the job I wanted. My transition into a leadership role was tough. So I went ahead and learned how I thought best. I made sure to sit next to a genius workforce person so I could learn terminology computations and how to optimize tools. I learned from leaders and my peers around me and never stopped inquiring. I watched and I asked—and I still do that to this day. I always look at everyone as my equal no matter the title or experience. Today when I present to organizations I find very few women at the table—but I tell myself that my voice will stand out and be heard no matter what. What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? Listen and share. The more we listen to one another the more we learn—and vice versa. And Share what you know because it makes your environment and support system stronger. What is your favorite thing about working at Alorica and what do you find most rewarding in your role? My favorite has got to be everyone I interact with—it’s such a family atmosphere! We’ve got the brightest most creative and hardest-working people at Alorica—and that makes me want to strive to be better every day. The most rewarding part for me is seeing so many coworkers grow within the organization; we’ve all been a part of one another’s success in some shape or form and we look out for each other.",

    "3 Principles Of Social Media Customer Service": "Multichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use it's become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that 99 percent of brands surveyed 1 were on Twitter while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account Social Media Examiner said citing Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand. With that in mind here are three principles to consider about social media customer service: 1. Different channel same service: Just because there's a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted the end goal is to directly address any question comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However if a customer makes a lighthearted comment then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive channel. 2. The quicker the response the better: The average response time for respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day a timely response is best practice when it comes to real­time communication. A Lithium Technologies study found that 53 percent of consumers 2 expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If brands neglect to respond consumers take punishing actions. For example 60 percent of respondents said they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly. 3. A social persona should be passive: When it comes to customer response companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive if anything. There are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores but that doesn't give it a free pass to negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition. SOURCES 1 2",

    "Do You Know Where Your Customers Data Is Utilities Need An Expert In Pci Compliance": "Security sure isn’t what it used to be! If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare retail and finance industries have taught us anything it’s that businesses need to seriously assess their data security. Now more than ever utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft with hackers taking advantage of lax security standards. Physical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers’ data is an essential component of providing top-notch customer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security it’s important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can be used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques. When selecting an outsourcing partner here are three considerations your utility company should keep in mind: Is your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant? Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience) or you are not PCI compliant in-house it’s critically important that your outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant. There are however varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification but rather tout “self-assessment”—which essentially means that they may not have been independently assessed nor approved by leading credit card providers. Be sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer: Is the outsourcing partner PCI compliant? If yes has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or are they self-assessed? Is the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list? Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA visit the PCI Security Standard’s website 1 and view their list of certified companies. Can your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data? In 2013 45 percent of data thefts 2 involved non-payment card data. Protecting your customers’ payment data is vitally important but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers’ other personal data vulnerable. Remember—it’s not just payment data at risk so it’s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry like utilities customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account number phone number address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number. If non-payment data is breached it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012 nearly 2 million customers of two New York-based utility companies 3 had personal data such as their social security numbers birthdates and other account information exposed. Since then the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data—payment and non-payment—ask your outsourcing partner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected. Does your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout the customer journey? You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures but it’s also important to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. Consider questions like these: Do your customers have the same experience with your payment processing partner as they do with your own representatives? How much control do you have over these interactions? Is your partner committed to providing an exceptional customer experience 4 every time? Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS ® and customer satisfaction outcomes? Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers it’s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the Harvard Business Review 5 last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year compared to 74% who have positive experiences. You need to be certain you’re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions with your outsourcing partner! Selecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It’s about securing your customer’s data—all of it—and ensuring that every interaction with your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind when choosing your partner you’ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that’s truly win-win. SOURCES 1 2 3 4 5",
    "What Makes A Company A Great Place To Work": "The company you work for matters; oftentimes we spend more time working with our colleagues than even seeing our friends and family. As I reflect on my last 20+ years working as a global Talent Acquisition leader I've come to realize that the concept of an ideal workplace varies greatly from person to person. It hinges on factors like our personal goals age interests location financial situation and more. Job seekers’ preferences can shift daily but there's one constant thread that unites us. Regardless of our job title or experience level we all seek out companies that foster a culture of support growth and inclusion. While there's no one-size-fits-all way to tell if a company prioritizes its employees there are a few qualities that all the best companies embody. A Diverse Workforce Any company can say DEI (Diversity Equity & Inclusion) is important to them but you want to look for employers that can give concrete examples of their commitment. Do they have diverse representation across their workforce? What about within their leadership team? There are many benefits to a strong DEI-focused culture; it allows employees to feel comfortable being themselves and confident to do their best work. According to the McKinsey report Delivering through Diversity diverse companies attract top talent and have better financial performance. At Alorica a global CX provider diversity is in our roots. We are the largest certified minority-owned BPO and as an example 60% of our workforce is made up of women. In fact we won an award for our Achievement in Promoting and Developing Women. We are also proud to be awarded as a Top Place to Work by Ragan Awards for our DEI initiatives. Healthy Work-Life Balance When you're considering potential employers work-life balance should be non-negotiable. Achieving a healthy balance between your personal and professional life has a significant impact on your mental and physical well-being. Research from Frontiers Media has shown that when there's a conflict between work and life it can lead to lower productivity and performance potentially holding back your career. At Alorica we offer a standard five-day work week and organize free health talk sessions as well as health checkup camps. Through our TIDE (Together for Inclusion Diversity and Equity) program we create a safe and welcoming space for employees to openly and respectfully discuss social issues we face in our communities. Opportunities for Learning and Growth There is nothing quite like a workplace that values your growth and development. Whether it is through training programs new projects or helping another team finding a company that believes in your potential and is ready to invest in it is key. It opens limitless possibilities in your career making you more adaptable and versatile. As leaders we can kickstart this process for future leaders. I take pride in being part of a company that invests in its employees at all levels whether they are just starting or seasoned leaders. We get the chance to learn new skills through training programs led by experts from around the globe which makes us more capable of tackling fresh challenges. Over 80% of our management roles last year were filled from internal promotions. That is the result of working for a company that cares about its people and their career journey. So now you know what to look for but how do you know what a company’s work culture is really like? You can: Dive into their website to see if their values mission and activities resonate with you. Ask yourself ‘is this a company (or leader) I’d be proud to work for? Don’t shy away from asking questions during the interview that help YOU decide if you want the job. We love candidates who are clear about their expectations and eager to learn more about our company. Go check out the work environment. Can you imagine working there? Alorica offers walk-in interviews at our sites so that we can make the hiring process very efficient. We get to know our candidates in person and they get a sense of who we are too!",
    "The Five Keys Of Content Moderation": "Content Moderation—the practice of screening approving or removing user-generated content based on pre-determined guidelines—is an essential component of the social media landscape. Over 4.74B people use social media platforms—including over 75% of the global population aged 13 and up—resulting in a worldwide daily average use of nearly 2.5 hours 1 . And with so many people online creating safe spaces to transact and interact is becoming more challenging than ever before. A Seismic Shift Meets a Clear and Present Danger The world is online using social media to share opinions and argue talking points in numbers never seen before; in the U.S. alone a staggering 84% of 18-29 year olds are active social media users with numbers only falling slightly to 81% for 30-49 year olds 2 . Unfortunately explicit content misleading information deepfake videos and conspiracy theories are skyrocketing alongside an explosion in platform use. Such material erodes trust and confidence in our country’s (and indeed the world’s) most critical institutions—and puts individuals brands and even established traditions at risk. So what do you do to counter a growing digital threat? You deploy a combination of leading-edge technology and human oversight—and you select a partner who understands how to get the job done. Five Keys to Consider Deploying successful content moderation is no small task—and it’s critical to get it right before bad actors can impact your brand reputation. Here are five factors to keep in mind when selecting a partner: Speed to Scale: Find a partner who can easily support your needs—especially when they’re urgently needed. Your ideal partner should be able to support rapid ramps worldwide handle high volumes of published content and have a legacy of ramping programs swiftly and successfully. Trust & Safety Expertise: Experience matters—especially with content moderation. And that takes a combination of top-tier talent plus safety protocols and regulatory know-how to keep both clients and frontline moderators secure; the best partners have both. Performance: A great partner has a proven track record plus a platform that harnesses automation technology AI and deep analytics to make easy work of moderating multi-media content. Talent & Training: Top-tier talent doesn’t just happen…a trust-worthy partner hires trains coaches and fortifies their frontline content moderators ensuring consistency and scalability in any region. A solid partner continually optimizes the capabilities of its workforce to consistently deliver through ongoing training from expanding existing skillsets to keeping up with policy changes. Wellness: Best-practice based wellness policies are essential for content moderation success—partners should care for their people by offering global wellness and resiliency programs led by licensed mental health practitioners. Daily monitoring of employee wellness mood and satisfaction also helps ensure that your first line of defense is always up for the task. We’re In This Together While the world is more connected than ever our interlocked societies struggle with bad actors who sully digital platforms with vitriol manipulation and lies. Major platforms like Facebook Instagram and TikTok have recently stepped-up activities to curtail the spread of misleading information but free-speech arguments are quick to emerge—and the moderation landscape is evolving daily. Like it or not social media has become the media —and though journalists possess credentials and routinely fact-check their work product everyday citizens do not. So it’s imperative that we prioritize moderation efforts and empower our people to safeguard online interests. At the end of the day the content is here—and moderation is there to meet it.

    "Getting Into Contact Center Automation Youll Need A Strategic Framework First": "Deciding to make the move to automation is one thing. Knowing where to start is another. No doubt you’ve done your homework—read the latest blogs and eBooks like 5 Ways to Drive Calls Out of Your Call Center — yet you still can’t quite figure out how to get started. That’s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service. Remember automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for building a strategic framework you’ll be able to distinguish the simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework is as simple as two steps. Step 1: Dial in on Demographics Consider the demographic of your caller—and your industry. A West Interactive Services CX Marks the Spot study found that customers’ likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service depends on the service provided. 1 Take the Government Services/Healthcare sector for example. While there is a larger appetite for interactive channels including online chat self-help etc. fewer customers are open to a mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast in the Automotive sector the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted channels. When it comes to age non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a traditional service channel—phone email in-person chat or self-help–whereas a Millennial is 5 to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media platform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for self-service automation. Launch your self-service engagement strategy early on leveraging your customers’ profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how when and where to market and engage customers on the available self-service channel options. After all you want to bring the greatest value–targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer. Step 2: Revisit Customer Data Take a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example – are they calling for password resets package tracking balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving then it is more suitable for automation. Then analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense of resolution? While originally designed for repeat contact reduction the same steps work for all contacts. Identify contact reasons develop solutions check in to see that the plan is working and act to achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice to take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience. Drawing conclusions from the data you already have positions you for a meaningful conversation about where to go with the automation of your business processes. Still need help?

Unlike traditional mail services the client’s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding high-end medications while also providing those customers new services for consideration. Consequently the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales. As they say in Gotham when the Commissioner calls you pick up. And we do. THE SOLUTION Alorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client’s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers. That’s right. We doubled our workforce. That’s just the kind of thing we do for our clients. But we digress. We deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensity-to-contact members ultimately reducing the client’s overall cost per prescription. Furthermore we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations and created welcome calls as part of a member’s engagement strategy. To do so we analyzed landline leads conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week in which to contact them. Finally we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case. THE RESULTS Top performer for increasing prescription conversions per contact by 10-15% Consistently a top performer among all of the client’s internal contact centers Since implementing Alorica’s custom program the client has experienced a 6% increase on member scores and a 19% increase on provider scores Click above to download the full case study.",
    "Burnout Stinks Signs And Solutions To Prevent Call Center Burnout": "The burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc. 2017). Additionally a recent survey found that employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%) unreasonable workload (32%) and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty picture for the men and women in our organizations. It’s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it’s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie 2017). Contact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor customer service representatives (CSR) or customer service agents employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than the national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta 2014). What Exactly is Employee Burnout? The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn’t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as “a syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do ‘people work’ of some kind” (Jackson 1981). In the contact center world burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister 2016) agents want to deliver excellent service in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers. Agents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service. What Are Those Burnout Symptoms? Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily with the expectation to create empathy rapport and even trust one can become very detached from their work. It’s an uphill battle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson 1981): Increased Emotional Exhaustion: Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level. Cynicism Towards Customers: Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion. Professional Efficacy: “The tendency to evaluate oneself negatively particularly regarding one’s work with customers.” In other words when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance the consequences can be quite severe and detrimental to employees their customers and ultimately to the organization. Solutions to Prevent Agent Burnout In my experience burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion cynicism and professional efficacy. To prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must: 1. Avoid Favoritism : Treat people with respect and treat people fairly without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one person or group against another will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved. 2. Have Clear Values : Make sure that operational processes and the company’s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees perceive a value conflict on the job their engagement with work tends to decrease. 3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: Establish continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact center environment. 4. Understand the Contact Center Environment: Training or seminars can enhance the employee’s capacity to cope with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead the organization should start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself. Burnout is commonplace and no one is immune to it. It’s important to structure your work environment so that every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed. At Alorica we’re focused on creating insanely great customer interactions. It starts with providing a healthy work environment for our people filled with a culture rooted in fun encouragement and collaboration.

    "Future Of Trust And Safety Blog": "The Trust & Safety Professional Organization (TSPA) is a global community of Trust & Safety professionals who develop and enforce principles policies and practices to create online standards of behavior and content facilitated by digital technologies. The association is overseen by venerated tech pioneers legal experts and professors including former COOs of Mozilla and Heads of Policy from Pinterest Facebook and Twitter. TPSA offers a comprehensive overview into Trust & Safety both as an industry and as a practice including The Future of Trust & Safety a review of new challenges presented by the continued evolution of technology and the pervasive nature of threats online. In the market overview the TSPA defines several key areas of focus; as a leading Trust & Safety provider for ~15 years our perspective offers a seasoned view on these trends. Increased investments to keep users safe As detailed by the TPSA companies have been investing more in Trust & Safety particularly over the past decade. Industries from nearly every niche are prioritizing online safety from beefing up security to harnessing AI/NLP technology to streamline multi-media moderation efforts. For online platforms and eCommerce websites keeping users safe is a top priority—safeguarding against bad actors fraud and malicious content is essential to bottom lines—requiring constant oversight and action in an ever-changing landscape. Keeping ahead of the curve is essential for successful content moderation as well as anticipating client needs. Investing heavily in leading-edge technology and top-tier talent partnering with third-party technology developers and working with diverse global Trust & Safety teams gives companies an advantage against online threats. And we couldn’t agree more; our many investments include implementing proprietary and third-party tools to streamline multilingual multi-media content moderation speed up collaboration and information flow and enhance training coaching and retention. But in our experience we’ve found that it’s just as important to take care of your frontline content moderators those intrepid individuals staring down online threats day after day. Caring for our people is a bedrock principle at Alorica; digital gamified apps and to assess engagement and mood ongoing wellness coaching and training as well as anytime access to licensed mental health professionals keep our content moderators going strong. Proactive and protective efforts As bad actors and cybercriminals become increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity strategies continually evolve to meet new threats. A highlight of the TPSA report is the importance of keeping customers and clients safe online; this requires a deep understanding of the different ways users can be harmed as well as how they act with online platforms. Successful Trust & Safety efforts adapt to policy changes keeping both clients and content moderators up-to-date about what threats are out there—and what can be done about them. We’ve found deep analytics to be absolutely invaluable for illuminating user behavior as well as isolating known threats. To best support the needs and requirements of leading global brands Alorica’s approach relies on a combination of data-driven analytics a nimble and scalable worldwide workforce proprietary technology and training models to ensure content moderation is always accurate expedient and based on intent local context current events and community guidelines. Keeping in lockstep with new legislation and regulations What’s online has been influencing everything from public policy to fashion trends for over a quarter century and how people communicate in online spaces has become increasingly important to everyone from governments corporations and organizations to individuals. As the TPSA advises free expression is vital to online communities but companies and countries often have to grapple with what’s said and spread online without existing guidelines creating new policies quickly because users expect the platforms they use to be safe and secure at all times. In practice we’ve found that it’s essential to keep up with corporate policies and regulatory changes and continually educate all Trust & Safety specialists including content moderators as well as proactively prepare for changing requirements.

    "Weve Got Their Back Ups A Hiring Analytics Case Study": "The client—a security software company—required a very specific agent profile to provide world-class technical support to their highly-knowledgeable customer base. After a complete assessment we concluded that our proprietary hiring analytics platform would play a key role in sourcing the right talent for this nearshore operation. Download our We've Got Their Back (Up's)! A Hiring Analytics Case Study to learn more. THE CHALLENGE Launch a nearshore operation—close to the client’s home-base and with agents who possess strong English-speaking skills Identify train and deploy a team of qualified agents to handle chat and email channels Demonstrate success in the first wave and prepare for a larger deployment THE OUTCOME Using hiring analytics and advanced agent profiling 100% of chat/email applicants that were hired graduated training and passed rigorous client clearance QA processes with flying colors CSAT scores jumped by 73%; performing 10% higher vs. client’s in-house team We anticipate 150% growth with the client THE CHALLENGE Starting Small and Thinking Big. Handling chat and email channels can be more complicated than voice-based technical support work so finding a team of qualified agents presented as a unique test. The client discovered this first-hand as their existing team couldn’t run concurrent chats and made missteps—and simply didn’t have the bandwidth to support everything at once. Shortly after launching our program we successfully migrated the first wave of voice-support agents over to chat and email—and buoyed by their success prepared to expand. THE SOLUTION Multitasking to the Rescue! Our agents in this program are in a totally different kind of position; they not only need to be proficient in tech support but have to be able to toggle between multiple conversations at once. Our proprietary hiring analytics platform played a key role in sourcing the right talent; this technology allowed us to construct the ideal agent profile and we used the platform to screen candidates for their multitasking abilities ultimately hiring agents best suited for the complex multi-channel work. The new Jamaica-based team quickly exceeded expectations in both customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall Quality Assurance (QA). Coupled with cutting down Average Handle Time (AHT) and the cost savings this nearshore location offered the client was thrilled THE OUTCOME Ever-expanding Opportunities. Thanks to the success of the program we continue to absorb more volume from the client and we are currently exploring ways to expand lines of business. We began with just a few agents in this multi-channel support role and we’re on pace to more than quadruple the number of agents by the end of 2019. We estimate that that once the team is fully up to speed we’ll average up to two concurrent chats at all times—and we’re pretty darn proud of that",

    "Go Big And Go Home Work At Home Case Study": "UNPRECEDENTED TIMEFRAMES. UNREAL CIRCUMSTANCES. UNMATCHED RESULTS. Alorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model this wasn’t our first WAH rodeo. Far from it. In this instance we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable as we worked to migrate the client’s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment—in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative—and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we’ll get to all that. THE RESULTS Attrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&M) agents in the same program Customers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&M employees AHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&M Contact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents THE CHALLENGE Experience when it mattered most. Prior to COVID-19 all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program—including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that agents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing model the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still moving that many agents in such a short timeframe—and against the backdrop of COVID-19—was no small order THE SOLUTION Best practices for a best-in-class result. Time was of the essence and we had none to lose. Fortunately our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently. Existing best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents and as they adjusted to their new at-home environment we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both agents and leadership. These routines were grounded in a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards two-way virtual agent communication collaboration and top-notch leadership support—and were a vital component of previous and ongoing success. THE OUTCOME Leveraging the past and looking to the future. Several months into the new normal the client’s work-at-home teams consistently outperform their legacy B&M counterparts in key metrics. Today as regulations slowly allow employees to return on-site a hub-and-spoke model is being used; agents are acquiring skills in a B&M environment before ‘graduating’ to WAH when and if circumstances dictate In fact our success with the program has earned us a best-in-class reputation—against which now benchmark agent performance. It’s an unpredictable world out there—and preparedness and confidence in a solution goes a long way. ABOUT ALORICA Alorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

    "Build A Lean Mean Customer Knowledgebase Machine For Effortless Self Service": "A streamlined troubleshooting guide can help effectively resolve a customer issue and improve the overall customer experience. Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service environment or through an interactive voice response system (IVR). It’s a critical component of self-service designed to empower the customer through the resolution process. In a time of information overload it’s important to keep information accessible current and accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to Salesforce 75% of consumers say that say it is important to be able to interact with a company on their personal schedule. 1 Follow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution and increases overall satisfaction. After all the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making it easy for them to do business with you. Identify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve As you build your customer knowledgebase the first step is identifying possible scenarios or problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting. Some examples include: Setting up an account Resetting a password Accessing an account Reinstating service Adding services to the account This is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs). HAPs help you to identify where the customer is when the need for help arises. Your strategy for how to design and deliver customer facing service content would be impacted by the HAPs identified. A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed. A recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are recommending that specific brand. 2 As you think through potential reasons a customer would need support keep in mind the customer lifecycle of your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase. Create the Self-Service Content Now that you’ve compiled the list of potential customer issues it’s time to roll up your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential customer issues. The first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree and a process map. A decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on what occurs at each step. A process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an issue. When you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps it’s important that you think about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For example when you are guiding a customer through self-help it’s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the steps for resolution. It is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly. Resolving a customer’s issue through self-service doesn’t need to be complex. In a recent article Gartner states that organizations often have very complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and knowledge are key attributes of leading enterprises. 3 Developing content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for both self-service and contact center support the less content management you will need post-deployment. Understand How Often Your Content is Being Used In any business measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase. To measure the effectiveness of your content you need to understand how often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer’s issue. In a self-service environment you can include a question— Did this information resolve your issue? —after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps. In a contact center environment the agent can ask the question or you can collect the data through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey. In addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer’s issue it’s also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for searches. This insight will help you optimize your search functionality and your content management strategy. Maintain Your Self-Service Content A knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately it increases the effort required by your customers as they search through large quantities of content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt an unnecessary increase in call volumes. Even further too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand. Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand because of the ability to easily find the information or help they need. 4 You must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center but content management will ultimately drive your success. To be successful at content management define a process to update your knowledgebase. Establish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated. Maintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates. Update the key search words based on current content available. Remove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites replace the original articles. The support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their own issues in a way that’s fast and easy. A study by Ganter predicts that by 2020 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever needing to interact with another person. 5 In this DIY era offering self-service is a necessity. It shows you are listening and understand the way your customers want to be served. Meanwhile it deflects unnecessary call volumes thereby reducing your overall cost per transaction. Using an effective knowledgebase content plan to deliver an effortless self-service experience compliments customer support and provides the customer multiple ways to resolve their issue. When done effectively this drives improvement in the overall customer experience and improves how customers feel about your brand.

    "Finding Your Own Work Passion": "When Karly Jandoc Alorica’s Sr. Director Talent Acquisition was in college she knew one thing for sure about her career goals. She wanted to work with people because building relationships was her passion. So it’s no surprise that a job in recruiting was her next step. With a background in temporary staffing employment management in the hotel industry and corporate recruiting her role at Alorica has allowed her to meld her two strengths together: managing teams and matching individuals with the right job opportunities. She has found success by truly believing in what she’s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle courses that you can overcome. Read Karly’s full Q&A below: Q: What gets you up in the morning? A: Knowing that I have a direct impact on really pleasing our customers and our clients and growing Alorica. Every day we have hundreds of agents starting in our organization. I love doing what I do because I know I am making a difference and I add the human touch into it. When I am visiting sites and I see the family feel and see people connecting to others I love knowing that people are making long-lasting relationships at work. Q: What are the key ways that you approach challenges in your day to day work? A: I’m a visual type of person. What I tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice is “okay list the obstacles and now let’s talk about how we will go about removing those obstacles.” Then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle. After you’ve gotten through your obstacle course it’s helpful to go back and in your mind list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and fixed them. Q: How do you view mentorship in the workplace? A: I advanced in my career because mentors set great examples. In my first job out of college I absorbed everything like a sponge. Whether they knew it or not there were people who I looked at for inspiration. Their actions helped me learn and grow. Today I find mentors everywhere--they are the people that leave me thinking after a phone call. They get my mind turning help me understand challenges and get me thinking about how I can take control of what I can control. Q: What motivated you in pursuing this career path? A: I wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people. In recruiting you’re always giving good news. “You got a job! Congratulations!” If I can go to bed at night thinking to myself “Today I placed 30 people in positions I know they’re excited and I’m excited.” That was my drive for choosing my own job roles throughout my career. Q: Did you have a specific career plan that led to your current role at Alorica? A: For me it hasn’t necessarily been about making a long-term career plan. An opportunity came up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a Sr. Director of Talent Acquisition. It helped get me back into managing people an area in which I am also passionate about. Having been with Alorica for almost six years I love making an impact on the organization in both areas.",

Illustrating this point beautifully is this month’s Alorican in Action VP of Client Solutions Beverley Bridges . Read Beverley’s Q&A below to explore her unique 13-year career at Alorica (and counting) and advice for succeeding on your own path. Q: Did you have a plan to reach an executive-level position? A: I’d like to say that I strategically orchestrated my career every step of the way but that would be a lie. Being successful has meant always doing my best recognizing that I am responsible for the choices that I make and treating people how I want them to treat me. I believe that diversity is what makes us great so I like to bring my perspective to situations and encourage others to do so as well. Q: Did you ever work with a mentor and did that process help you? A: I have a lot of mentors—and most of them don’t even know I see them that way! My philosophy is that the life you live speaks louder than the words you say . Mentors have been both colleagues and people I know outside of work—almost everyone has taught me something. Q: What advice would you give about climbing the career ladder? A: Know your value. If you don’t know it nobody else will. Also lift others as you climb and don’t give up or give in if your career track isn’t going as you imagined—resiliency is a great skill to master. Lastly don’t burn bridges. You never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague for advice or a fresh point of view. Q: What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? A: My grandmother and mother always said “get in where you fit in.” Through my regular one-on-one meetings with each of my clients I try to find commonalities; it doesn’t have to be about work but perhaps family hobbies upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us. Connecting with people is how you build trust and respect. Q: What excites you most about what you do? A: Taking on new challenges. The hurdles are exciting and once you get to the other side of it you can say “this is what we did.” What also brings me joy is keeping people motivated. I think it’s very important as women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward. Surround yourself with people who share your goals and objectives and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track. You may not always like what they have to say but as women authentic relationships are critical.",

    "Speak Up And Share Every Voice Matters": "Six-foot-tall Pency Smith says she can sometimes seem intimidating especially when she’s thinking. Armed with a master’s degree in philosophy this Director of Client Solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the root causes of an issue and to help guide her to a solution. Pency started out as an agent and has since held positions in quality training and operations management. She believes change can be scary but it’s also good. Read her full Q&A below. What professional advice has helped you in your career? Early on I was trying to fit into the mold of what I thought a young strong black woman in corporate America was supposed to be like. I have a really big personality I’m very opinionated and I can come off a little harsh sometimes but I was silencing myself. Then Colleen Beers gave me the best advice: she said to “be Pency.” That really freed me up to come into my own. Looking back do you regret any career moves you did or didn’t make? Once Andy Lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve but I didn’t speak up because I didn’t want to come off as a know-it-all or be a troublemaker. I wasn’t being Pency! I really regret not using my voice when I had the opportunity but I don’t hold back anymore. How can we all continue to better ourselves at work? Our success is dependent upon each other so see what you can do to improve. Take every class and attend every conference that’s offered to you. Last year I attended COPC certification training and it was my most eye-opening experience ever both personally and professionally. What does it take to build lasting relationships with colleagues clients and other contacts? A lot of people have difficulty delivering bad news especially to clients but my main thing is honest communication. I won’t sugarcoat it I’ll just say it. And if it can be fixed they know that I’ll roll up my sleeves and dig in. What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? Be honest. Let your personality come through and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. A meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone and they’re who they are to you. It’s the only way.",

    "10 Tech Executives Share Marketing Trends And Predictions For 2021": "What’s on the horizon for marketers this year? To find out I sought insight from the following nine tech executives . We will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing. Juliette Rizkallah Chief Marketing Officer SailPoint “Standard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches to handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in that funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.” In terms of digital fluency marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we’d be going into 2021. Alicia Tillman Global Chief Marketing Officer at SAP “The technology the tactics the flexible mindset – with these tools disruption is no longer the showstopper it once was. As the world moves forward day by day marketers are more prepared than ever to be agile and deliver the experiences audiences need when they need them. Rather than months-long marketing campaigns brand marketing will more closely mirror the way we’re living our lives as individuals. In the moment deeply empathetic and tuned into each other’s needs.” We will see a stark divide in an organization’s marketing budget spend followed by consequential impact. Jim Kruger Chief Marketing Officer Veeam “With the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year there will be a resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end companies will look to cut back on marketing budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be managed up or down fairly easily. On the other end companies will increase investment in marketing because they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will ultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on and by toggling budgets up and down past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue to invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.” Verifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. Dan Lowden Chief Marketing Officer White Ops “In 2021 marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing spend. Marketers will partner with specialists that can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans – resulting in better customer experience ensuring higher engagement bringing visibility to cleaner data improving the company's compliance position and driving stronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is effectively spent.” Recent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise their walls even higher. Abhay Singhal CEO InMobi Marketing Cloud “This is an extremely uncertain period of time and CMOs shouldn’t have one roadmap – they should have multiple. For starters marketing teams will need to be prepared to make the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing within the app. On the flip side marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as possible. Without this advertisers are at risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over which compromises brand image and user experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical and marketers need to start setting expectations and redefining metrics as soon as possible.” Company culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing talent. Amanda Bohne Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta “Now that so many companies have proven that for many remote work can be as effective as in-office work it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will now be sought after by companies located across the country enabling them to potentially live somewhere different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company where in-office work is mandated will start to meaningfully impact your candidate pool and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.” No matter what product you sell what you need to market is trust. Dale Renner CEO Co-Founder RedPoint Global “Consumers want trust in the product quality trust in the organization handling your data trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs trust that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately driven through a series of interactions – those brands that are responsible with a consumer’s data and use it to create value for the consumer those that provide consistent experiences those that operate at the consumer’s cadence will build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy will experience a dramatic decline in customer loyalty and brand value. ” B2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with existing customers. Elena Filimonova SVP Marketing CGS “Marketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits of their service while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers Marketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the current environment.” Google and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and data privacy. Susan Lee Chief Product Officer Valassis “In the new year it’s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on a one-to-one or known basis. Instead marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base maximizing scale.” Omnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty. Colson Hillier Chief Marketing Officer Alorica Inc. “In today’s 'continuously-connected' way of life it’s not enough that brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX—being able to alternate quickly from different platforms but for these channels to also be personalized persistent and effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021 you’ll see more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers’ wants through advanced analytics and embedded intelligence which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that allow brands to market sell and serve their customers better and faster. When brands proactively ‘push’ tailored experiences rather than rely on customers to ‘pull’ from services after they’ve had a problem that changes the nature of the relationship offering insights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of always-connected consumers new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights context and channels that ultimately redefine brand loyalty.” The article was originally published on Forbes.com at",
    "Designing A Survey Strategy 6 Tips For Success": "A common topic of conversation in the customer experience world is the ideal customer satisfaction survey. How many questions should it include? What are the right channels? How do you increase survey return rates? While these questions make sense are they the right questions to ask? Rather than trying to find the perfect survey (minimal questions with insightful answers and a high rate of return) companies should consider asking a different question—is the current method for delivering surveys generating the data needed to improve the business as well as the overall customer experience? A better use of time and resources is to reevaluate the strategy used to gather sentiment. Use these 6 tips as a starting point to help ensure that you continually receive useful data from the consumers that best represent your customer base. 1. Ask the right people. The people answering your surveys are likely not the best representatives of your customer base. According to Gartner the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and very upset. This creates a data set that omits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the majority of the company’s customers. 1 To gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses crave it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate which leads to our next point. 2. Keep customers from saying ‘No way survey!’ Surveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your user quitting the survey part way through and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys. 2 Businesses who are focusing on how to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to communicate and tailor the channels utilized accordingly. 3. Ask the right questions. Several companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction questions. These general questions don’t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to improve a business. Survey Monkey suggests that companies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization—and making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights—is what will help you reach your goals. 3 Think about what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent performance customer loyalty to your brand or both? Answer these questions and you will know the questions to ask. 4. Keep the survey relevant. Gainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how the request arrives. 4 Traditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl * over 70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a purchase during a store visit. 5 Don’t be afraid to be bold when considering options! 5. Show the value. Customers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback on a product or experience. Don’t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole. Show customers a direct correlation between feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by trumpeting improvements made to products/services based on direct customer feedback. 6. Use the data available to you. Most businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and voice analytics solutions can be used to analyze interaction transcripts providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view several different aspects of their business—products support service options and agent interactions to name a few. This list doesn’t cover everything to consider for your customer feedback gathering strategy but it is a starting point. What other items would you consider?

    "Finding Ohmni Channel Nirvana 3 Ways To Get There": "Customers making contact expect a company to wrap together all forms of communication from traditional to social. In retail an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience whether they’re shopping online from a desktop or mobile device by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store. 1 In the contact center industry omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store. 2 By the time they connect with a contact center customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise they wouldn’t be calling to begin with. Consider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be recognized not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could or worse doesn’t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It’s crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn’t add significant length to the interaction. Many companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology but oftentimes integration with the contact center software is overlooked resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn’t allow for the continuous experience of true omnichannel excellence. In many cases multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration what’s left is a solution that causes more harm than good leaving the burden on the contact center agent to resolve a complicated case. As you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you’re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success. 1. System consolidation: How many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history? If the answer is more than one it’s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember the more history the front line is armed with the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience. 2. Multichannel platform integration: Does your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage? If the answer is no either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app web social media and AI the details of these touches must push to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience. 3. Employee experience considerations: Now that your most basic contacts are handled automatically what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents? As employee expectations become more complex training investments will be critical to ongoing success. Consider what concepts such as routine system changes can be easily adopted through online content delivery. While even the best Learning Management System will not replace the need for facilitator-led content moving simple content to employee self-service can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and procedural changes to be delivered live in a classroom environment. As you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities make sure your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will require additional expertise and research time especially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity you will invest in agents’ knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened expectations and to prevent employee pool burnout. This will also ensure you are attracting the right level of talent for the job. With self-service channels resulting in reduced contact volume the funding to provide necessary compensation adjustments should be readily available. With awareness and attention to these crucial details for a seamless integration you can confidently forge onward in your quest for automation. Developing a framework to address these three critical areas will help you avoid common pitfalls leading to true omnichannel leadership. Interested in learning more?

    "Increase Customer Satisfaction With Personalized Digital Cx Banking Solutions": "Personalized Digital Solutions + Seamless Customer Experiences = Higher CSAT FCR and NPS How to convert transactional interactions to long-term customer satisfaction in BFSI Here at Alorica—a global Customer Experience (CX) provider—I lead the efforts in engaging some of the most reputable financial institutions in the world to offer our customer support services as an extension of their business. One great question I get asked often from financial services executives is— how should they integrate ‘digital’ in a meaningful way to earn customers’ satisfaction trust and long-term business? The reality is consumers expect personalized service from the companies they do business with. And while for some industries like retail that’s innately part of every brand’s identity; for others like the banking financial services and insurance sector (BFSI) giving customers the digital experiences they want isn’t so simple. Here are some of BFSI’s challenges and the best ways to solve for them. Make It Personal Consumers particularly in the wake of the pandemic have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial institutions know them—especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information. For many large institutions the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause additional frustration. As a personal example when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card the customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not integrated. This made me feel undervalued as their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX solutions built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML along with system integration can help create tailored product recommendations savings plans and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. As Boston Consulting Group shared : “Ultimately if done well personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for banks.” Give Them Options In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude financial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver more rapid responses the need to keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use multiple channels to complete transactions it can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging situation. The customer will want to be heard discuss their options and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank employee will guide them through the process. That’s why balance and optionality are key. Self-service options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel solutions enhanced self-service options improved functionality across digital channels and 24/7 live support can help reduce the friction streamline disparate outcomes and make digital options easier for everyone. Partnerships You Can Bank On As pointed out in McKinsey & Company’s 2022 article : “for many [banks] a key struggle is that customer information is housed in different ways across the business and stove piped within functions preventing the bank from gaining a complete view of the customer” but by partnering with a CX expert who knows how to deliver the right blend of people processes and technology customers can get the personal experiences they want from the BFSI brands they do business with. Whether it’s adding automation technology with a human touch that can support multiple product types or creating seamless omnichannel experiences an experienced partner with scale security compliance and digital solutions built in can ensure optimal digital CX at every interaction. Because ultimately when customers feel like they are understood and they can trust us—especially with their finances— their financial institution’s wallet share grows. A strategic CX partner who knows how to deliver people-first flexible and secure solutions at scale across industries makes all the difference in earning LTV.",

    "Actionable Analytics": "WINNING MEANT WINNING BACK. When a client was looking to drive more members to its loyalty program they turned to a group that could transform information into insights—and win back their valued customers. THE CHALLENGE Increase adoption of their loyalty program Improve the win-back of members who hadn’t used the loyalty program for more than six months THE OUTCOME Increased loyalty activations by 20% and annual transactions by 17% The program generated a profit of $10 million—130% of the client’s goal The full solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group and 19% over the client’s internal sales team THE CLIENT So here’s what happened. A major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for Small/Medium Business (SMB) accounts. The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program and to improve the win-back of members who hadn’t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music. THE PROGRAM Phase 1 of the solution involved utilizing Alorica’s data scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring Model) comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling was thusly launched. Phase 2 implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members. Phase 3 saw Alorica providing full account management of the client’s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client’s profitability. Meanwhile a sales CRM system and digital sales strategy intelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics. And our CAE came through in the clutch delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer resulting in an optimal contact strategy increased positive customer experiences and higher revenues. THE RESULTS The revised Welcome Program increased loyalty activations by 20% and annual transactions by 17%. Meanwhile the win-back program increased usage by 37% generating a profit of $10 million – 130% of the client’s goal. And to top it off the full account management and analytical solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group and 19% over the client’s internal inside sales team.

    "Stick To It To Lead A Team First Be A Great Teammate": "With an appreciation for the creativity of writing advertising and graphic design Tonya Goforth pursued a degree in Business Management with an emphasis in Marketing. Since college she’s navigated her way through different positions in various industries gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way. Now as Alorica’s Director of Sales Enablement she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&A below. How did you reach your career goal of becoming a director? After I originally applied for the director position I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital part of the team so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn’t work out I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I’d be a great fit. My “stick-to-it-ness” paid off! What do you find most rewarding in your role? Seeing my team’s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we’re always working with several different people. Being in this central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation. Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way? I would definitely say (now Alorica’s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly Hanak-Weaver who I reported to as a proposal manager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team while empowering them too. I try to copy off her great leadership style—we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be. What’s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path? At any job it’s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your career changes you’ll find that by maintaining a professional network you’ll always have connections available for referrals advice and encouragement. Any additional advice for work life? Don’t be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change. And roll with challenging situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long run.",

    "Iamalorica Meet Lori And Genet": "They’re a friendship made in Alorica heaven … but this dynamic duo didn’t exactly start off on the right foot. The beginning. Before Genet and Lori met each other they were living a parallel course. Both joined El Paso East as agents and they were equally determined to move up the ranks. As they progressed through their leadership journey little did they know their Alorica paths were about to come together … Lori’s side of the story. “When I was hired in 2014 I set a goal to become an Operations Manager in five years. I was so excited that in just a matter of months I was offered a Team Manager position!” Lori explained. She was moving on up. And … her upcoming vacation was going to be even better knowing she was returning to her new role! She couldn’t wait to get back to work and was eager to meet her new boss. Of course she was a little nervous because after all first impressions are everything! When Lori returned to work she was reassured that her new team had performed well in her absence … because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation to make sure of it. (Uh-oh!) And now Genet’s side of the story. It was 2014 and Genet was elated to be offered a promotion from Team Manager to Shift Manager. Her leadership dreams were coming true! Not only was she killing it at work she also had a vacation planned soon. Things were definitely going her way. Or so she thought. Genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as Team Manager Ms. Lori Melendez had already requested personal time off. Therefore Genet as Lori’s new boss needed to skip her own vacation! Needless to say Genet wasn’t thrilled about this change of events. “Who IS this Lori person? She’s taking my team AND my vacation?!” Genet exclaimed. Unexpected friendships are the best ones. “Genet had to skip her vacation so I could take MINE!” Lori was horrified. This is not the way she wanted to start things off with her new boss! Eventually they were able to laugh about it. And they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually. That’s why a few months later when Genet received another promotion as Operations Manager for El Paso’s Outbound Team she immediately invited Lori to be her Team Manager. Not only did Genet and Lori successfully lead their team … they were ranked the #1 Outbound Team in Alorica. Because of their passion performance and belief in limitless possibilities they were eventually asked to oversee the Inbound Team too. What a major undertaking! Now four years later Genet and Lori are inseparable. Genet is leading the Inbound Team as Operations Manager. Lori achieved her goal as the Operations Manager of Outbound. And both departments are #1. Way to go Lori and Genet! Thank you for your perseverance and determination and for proving great things can happen when you least expect it.",

    "Sanjay Ponnappa Discusses Esat Growth Retention": "A company’s performance can’t be driven by simply setting goals or measuring KPIs. It’s leaders who play the most pivotal role in driving an organization’s success because a good leader can be a key reason why an employee joins stays at or leaves a company. Below are a few strategies that I have found to be vital in establishing a work environment where employees thrive: 1. Cultivate a culture of accountability: Recognizing that mistakes are an inevitable part of the development process fosters a learning-oriented environment rather than one solely focused on results. Encouraging employees to acknowledge their errors and learn from them not only enables them to feel like they can try new or hard things but also helps boost employee satisfaction and confidence. #BeBold 2. Lead by example: By taking the time to walk your employees through your thought process and actions for a project or challenge they’re able to quickly learn what to do. Especially if it’s their first time they can benefit from your experience and expertise. It also connects you more to your team which leads to trust engagement and high performance. #BeConnected 3. Instill a forward-focused vision: Don’t just give employees tasks or projects to complete. Constantly reinforce what the company’s goals are and how their work makes a difference. Empower employees to make decisions in their day-to-day work by helping them think about the company’s—and their own—long-term success. Create a vision articulate it regularly and share updates on the progress to achieving it. This will allow them to stay committed and focused on accomplishing sustainable growth. #BeRelentless As a leader it’s our responsibility to support our people to reach their full potential. That’s what most positively impacts the overall success of an organization. And most of all have integrity in every action. #BeTrue What are some leadership strategies that work for you?

    "Going Beyond Your Comfort Zone": "A favorite quote can speak volumes about a person’s mindset. Rita Saavedra Ortiz Alorica’s Site Director in Kingston Jamaica says that she references this Ralph Waldo Emerson quote often: “Do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” Rita’s personal story certainly fulfills that mantra. She started out as an agent in 2004 moved into quality nine months later and then switched to operations in 2011. Just a handful of months ago in January 2018 she moved from Panama to Jamaica to take on her newest challenge at the Kingston site. By seizing opportunities as they come Rita continues to grow and learn in her career and she inspires others around her to do the same. Read her full Q&A below: Q: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth? A: When I started working in operations seven years ago I learned the biggest lessons in my career. One of my mentors said if you fail just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your comfort zone. So I started out with a small account and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it—the exposure with the client getting into calls with client solutions making decisions about what is good for the business and getting to know the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big new site in Jamaica I knew I could do it even though it would be new for me. Q: What motivates you every day? A: I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable you are with yourself the better you can overcome the roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes whether good or bad. The fourth one is to get to know your people—not only at the professional level but at the personal level. Talking to people builds loyalty and that’s how you get people to not work for you but to work with you. Q: If you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now what would it be and why? A: Sometimes I think what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every decision I’ve made good or not so good they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with everything I have accomplished. I wouldn’t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to training I didn’t want to leave but it was a good decision. From there I got to try new things. There’s so many branches in this business. You’d be surprised about what you might succeed in. Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? A: I have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I’ve seen many women in this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in a man’s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama and I was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers. I was able to stand up and lead that task. Q: Do you think it is important to be a mentor? A: Right now my team is spread all over Panama and I am still mentoring them. When I see my people growing being insanely great even when we aren’t together I feel proud of myself. I am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan. You have to have someone else who can take care of your programs like a mini me. Mentoring is really important.",

    "Seizing The Automation Opportunity Alorica S Automated Discovery Process": "One of the first stumbling blocks of business process transformation is identifying meaningful automation opportunities. A typical process will have a management consultant system expert or Lean Six Sigma specialist to monitor manual processes for a set time collect performance data and make recommendations. Companies supplement this assessment with executive ideation sessions operational managers’ workshops and superuser interviews. The traditional way to speed up and improve the accuracy of this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet despite these efforts not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and prioritized. In this blog I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline ‘the discovery stage’ and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office. From manual to automated discovery Alorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage calling it ‘One-Click Automation’. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents’ desktop utilization on a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors the users’ screen toggle clicks data entries and entry type and tracks time per system and per screen the time duration for performing each step and the number of used fields. It counts errors frequency variance in the time and data entry quality the end-to-end handling time the complexity and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the underlying communication between systems and exchanged information. The bot does not capture personal data or other input information remaining non-invasive to the systems. It also does not intervene with the users’ actions. Once the bot collects enough information (~100k data points per LOB typically in two weeks) it creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens the start and end points the navigation between them and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product portfolios with multiple support processes (for example in technical support) Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe. Alorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results estimate savings opportunities and recommend and prioritize bot implementations with workflow business process exceptions adjudicator and look-up. Because the collected information shows the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data the created automation workflows make the bot training quicker and more precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation. Implementations for a healthcare client For a U.S. healthcare payer client Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant number of agent desktops for three days identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with tasks such as secondary claims research multifactor case clinical guidelines and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of agents who performed the particular process its recurrence and time taken. The team compared the results to the agent training guidelines then Alorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement. Alorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client’s voice and non-voice work. For example in the client’s back-office the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax. Using third-party RPA & AI partner tools Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or compliance requirements such as HIPAA. It also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount who translated the data from the claims to the systems. The company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a ‘digital workbench’ for back-office processes leading with automation. For automation opportunities in voice processes Alorica is working with several travel retail BFSI media and telecom brands. Automation in the process trenches The fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume time-consuming processes sizable FTE involvement high error rate or simply risk aversion by internal IT teams. To address the latter issue Alorica automation deployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising changing or modifying core client systems. The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion with the client’s process owners on the possible cost-benefit and ROI. A less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with dynamic changes of internal rules product/services and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will be quite short and its ROI smaller without human supervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the challenge of identifying process impact. To mitigate automation program redesigns Alorica’s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure with a steady release roadmap. Another challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost optimization and improved performance Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet looking to take over higher value processes and switching to performance-based pricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client Alorica structured the pricing by processed claim decreasing the overall cost by ~50%. The value of partnering for automation While broad statements for full automation attract media attention the reality for most companies is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider can deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario where the vendor has the process and domain expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and supplier network centers to maximize the benefits.",

To make the contest a little more interesting and in celebration of Alorica’s 20 th anniversary Chapters were also encouraged to incorporate this milestone into the photos they shared. And the winner is… Panama West ! The Panama West Chapter partnered with Fundación Creo en Ti (I Believe in You) an organization that fosters 65 young boys during the school year. And it just so happens that the non-profit is also celebrating its 20 th anniversary this year. School supplies and personal items were donated during the visit. But let’s face it we’re all winners here. Here is a recap of how a few of our other Chapters shared the ♥: Tucson West Ariz.

    "The Keys To Career Development Asking Questions And Showing Results": "When faced with a career opportunity is your inclination to go for it or to question your qualifications? Having the confidence to put yourself out there whether you have the exact matching skill set or not is one of the best learning opportunities there is according to Sharon Leal Alorica’s Director Operations based in San Antonio Texas. Sharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a “leap of faith” and joined the BPO industry--and she hasn’t looked back since. She’s a huge believer in speaking up asking questions and helping others achieve career growth. Read her full Q&A below: Q: How have mentors helped you in your career? A: I’ve always had great mentors. Early in my career a mentor told me “don’t expect what you don’t inspect.” Don’t assume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: “listen to understand.” We sit and we listen but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and be successful. Q: Can you share an example of how asking questions helped you to succeed? A: When I got the call back on my application for this company I asked to speak to someone who was currently in this position and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the site director position I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks. I went through agent training I took calls I sat with the QA team I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be set up for success to have credibility and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can’t be afraid to ask and asking isn’t a weakness. Q: Do you think there is still a glass ceiling? Why or why not? A: I was told at my previous job when I got to a director level that I was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman. I told them I don’t agree I have worked really hard I earned this position and it wasn’t just given to me. I don’t see this at Alorica. Females can underestimate themselves and sometimes aren’t confident enough to say “I want to move to the next level.” I’ve never been shy about that. Show your confidence shake a hand stand up and show that you know your business. Q: What aspects of the company stand out to you as an employee? A: My goal is to continue to learn everything Alorica has available to us. I’m on the board of directors of MLBA and I love that we can help employees. I love everything Alorica is doing with social media—that continues to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees. Culture is very important. There are 25 other call centers in San Antonio but people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy. Q: How do you inspire others to grow in their careers? A: When I am mentoring or working with someone I find out where they want to go and what they need to do that. You’ve got to have goals work hard and not wait on opportunities even if you’re not an exact match. I’ll do a mock interview with you and I’ll look at your credentials. Sometimes people want a bachelor’s degree—but well I don’t have one! But if you have experience and show your results you may be the most qualified candidate. Don’t be afraid to apply and learn from the experience.",

    "4 Ways To Turn Your Customers Experience Into Continuous Improvement": "The moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or service is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer support call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation. 1. Know Your Customer Segmentation is powerful. When your customers ask for assistance it’s important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment. Demographic information goes without saying but focus should also be given to the type of customer a person is. How long have they been a customer? How many of your products do they own? How often are they reaching out for support? What past issues have they needed assistance with? Having this insight helps in the way you communicate with the customer later while also helping you understand how to position self-service and working to find the right solution. 2. Identify the Problem It may seem simple but often companies are not collecting information around why the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue type is critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better self-service content while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus on driving improvements. In the Forrester article “ Insights-Driven Business Set the Pace for Global Growth” Forrester references that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with close-looped learning processes.” 1 In an era where information changes so rapidly the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better for the customer the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level. 3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their support experience. However it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to resolve the issue. The more effort required the more the experience deteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook Deflecting Call Volume ; resolution is identified as the largest influencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only detrimental to experience scores but also they are expensive to support. Therefore understanding what drives and prevents resolution is a critical component of your contact reduction strategy. 2 When we think of resolution we think of it two ways. First Contact Resolution: It’s crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or knowledgebase articles are solving your customer’s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content potentially reducing support calls and driving improvement in customer support. Issue Resolution: Issue resolution is a measurement of whether the customer’s issue was resolved. It’s important to understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where you typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred escalation to a higher level of support etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved you will likely see an impact to their overall experience given the delay in resolution. Remember resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain customer loyalty. 4. Build Brand Loyalty One of the best indicators of a customer’s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem will allow you to better understand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. Information is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn will set you apart from others in your industry. In a recent blog by COPC “The Value of Listening: How feedback can be an opportunity to bring brand image to life” the author mentions that customers are paying more attention to how a brand responds than ever before. 3 As you better understand your customer segment how often they call the types of issues that occur for them what upsets them and the speed with which you can help them you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar customers. When you listen to your customers and begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner you reduce the frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your customers. Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a support model that simplifies the path to your customers’ resolution is important. As you leverage learnings from your customers’ experiences and incorporate those into your ever-changing support model you begin to reduce the number of support calls required the length of the call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of your support model will go down and you will gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their problems. Customers know issues will arise but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what will set you apart from your competition. SOURCES “Deflecting Call Volume” Alorica 2017 .

    "6 Reasons Why Millennials Are Better Than Their Stereotype": "Shaming our youth is a tradition as old as dirt. In recent history Generation X was known as a group of “Slackers.” Before Gen X the original “ME” generation was the “Hippies” the Baby Boomers who are now so worried about these “lazy entitled narcissistic” Millennials. You can’t understand anyone accurately when you’re judging them… and that’s exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes. Greg Johnson Chairman and CEO Damar Services said “I find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have encountered many who are thoughtful resourceful open-minded and even visionary community stewards … Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.” 1 And for contact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor market—with 56 million now working. 2 Rather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly get to know them as individuals. You’ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground! You would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly we haven’t. This is one “way that it’s always been done” that it’s time to let go of and here are 6 great reasons why. #1. Data doesn’t tell the whole story Millennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind the reality is that they are not that different from the generations that came before them. 3 While the data we read may be statistically accurate much of it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science—like the reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup Organization—while accurate doesn’t tell the context of the Millennial experience. Why? Because these surveys don’t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new life stage called “ emerging adulthood ”. According to Haydn Shaw generational and cultural differences expert recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28 is important because “ if it’s the Millennials then it’s a problem that needs to be fixed…if it’s a life stage it’s a change that we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.” #2. Millennials work to live not live to work Millennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives—even above their careers. According to Darlene Corbett a therapist and success coach “like many generations before Millennials marriage and family are part of the big picture for the Millennial population. 4 But there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families and fulfill career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for leadership development they should create a work environment that respects personal values especially related to family. Find ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to build a great career without damaging their personal relationships. #3. Millennials desire personal growth Work-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the things that matter most to them—such as health family and leisure time. 5 Millennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous feedback and coaching and that’s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore capitalize on the opportunity to mentor them. Gen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY the purpose behind how work gets done every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them encourage them inspire and motivate them and challenge them to greatness. Companies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise invest in those who need and desperately want to grow? Sounds like a win-win. #4. Millennials live their ideals According to Jean Case Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation Millennials invest in the things they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy than in previous years and put an emphasis on CSR in the workplace. 6 A common adage in leadership is to “walk the talk”. Well Millennials are doing just that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on or better yet follow suit. Recognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in organizations. #5. Millennials number 73 million Millennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America’s largest generation in 2019 with 73 million individuals. In fact as of 2017 Millennials were already the largest population in the workforce—with 56 million working or looking for work. 7 #6. Millennials are the future (like it or not) As Padraig Cotter points out “Millennials are redesigning the future of work. They’re digital natives and it’s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it’s about the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking are crucial and Millennials can provide this.” 8 Oftentimes fear holds us back – fear of the unknown fear of change or just blind fear. But there’s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make their mark on the world. Let’s not succumb to fear and judgment just because we don’t know or understand them. Millennials and contact centers are a perfect match. Get behind Millennials invest in them and support them as they take you to places you’ve never gone before!

    "Utility Industry Looks To Omnichannel Support": "It all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review. Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada representing more than 39 million residential accounts 1 . Of those 44 percent receive services 2 from a retail energy provider (REP) as of year-end 2014. Although the legislative environment is still very much in flux utility companies increasingly recognize the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product or service new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the consumer relationship. In this highly controlled industry demand from utility providers REPs and consumers to provide more immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction with consumers. Currently Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to communication—specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues related to service and payments can be conducted.­­ As a result many companies have moved to un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified operation for three key reasons: Consistency Focus on Customer Experience and Improved Revenue Recovery . Alorica a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector has introduced Financial Care (through its subsidiary EGS Financial Care Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the industry that focuses on Care First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation who prefer Web-based self-service options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid energy). As they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels utility regulators and electricity providers should consider the following market trends: Consumers are increasingly mobile. Smartphone technology and cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere anytime – everything from turning devices on and off to re-programming their thermostat settings to making a payment. And as technology continues to advance consumers will look for further innovation from utility providers related to mobile platforms. Consumers want more control over costs. The idea of prepaid electric service – based on previous consumption rates – has already gained traction with consumers who are now seeing energy savings between 5.5 and 14 percent 3 . However this model brings with it new challenges; specifically protecting customers who may underestimate their usage particularly because utility companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service 4 . Smart meters mean more programs. Smart meters which measure energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes have opened up opportunities for time-based rate programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates consumers can benefit 5 from the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates. Energy companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings. New developments in technology combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices means that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences or be left behind with antiquated systems and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly tools electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further positive change for the industry as a whole. When you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience resources and PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions—eliminating significant capital expense time delay and HR challenges. Through outsourcing Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience and satisfaction ratings. Talk about a brighter outlook for everyone. SOURCES 1 2 3 4 5",

    "Level Up Gamer Loyalty In Digital First Experience Economy": "There are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts & online events to patches and expansion packs game developers publishers and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns that entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building—and brand loyalty—is customer support which has taken on greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers. The current gaming boom is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive growth in the past with eight generations of consoles recruiting a whole new crop of hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery ordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank grocer retailer streamer and game provider can and should do the same. As a result a comprehensive player support strategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation. All-Inclusive Player Support The gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management tech support and everything in between. The gaming craze that took shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew by the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics such as account management & payment processing plus community moderation knowledge management expansion live events support and protecting gamers against fraud. Then there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe so video game companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every time zone. Even better support agents should have the regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down gaming companies need to adopt robust CX services now or risk losing players to the companies that do. Building Loyalty Outside the Game Regardless of industry market data consistently demonstrates that positive customer experiences are a major competitive differentiator. The challenge is that customer experiences in 2021 look a lot different than they did a decade ago. For starters consumers have dramatically changed the way they communicate with one another. Millennials and Generation Z have jumpstarted this shift. These digital natives overwhelmingly prefer to communicate via digital messaging tools as opposed to traditional channels – and this appears to apply whether they are engaging their best friends or their favorite brands . Overall the younger generations are more comfortable with digital channels whether they are powered by humans or bots. It also follows the logic that Generation Z is more open to using AI-powered chatbots because they have experience with AI applications from the games they grew up with. Deploying virtual assistants makes it easier for tech-savvy consumers to engage brands while supplying contact centers the extra bandwidth to resolve any number of issues. The point is to give consumers choice. Introducing omnichannel functionality through voice and text-based capabilities enables support teams to meet players through their favorite channels creating positive impressions in the process. The number one goal of every developer and publisher should be that players are spending their time on game play and not support issues. Cultivating Trust and Safety As gaming companies continue to develop multiple revenue streams the risk and volume of fraud not to mention account abuse are sure to increase. The average player today is more likely to engage brands outside the game whether that’s consuming YouTube reviews Twitch live streams podcast recordings message boards and the targeted journalism devoted to gaming. The abundance of media today has seeped into the mainstream exposing players to content that was traditionally only seen or heard by the most serious of fans. And with consumers having a heightened awareness of privacy and security video game companies must protect players efficiently and responsively from fraud across all channels. Companies that provide reliable safe environments are more likely to realize player community growth. As consumer behavior and expectations change so too must player support. As much as game developers publishers and cloud platforms prioritize developing the coolest most popular games they also need to place emphasis on offering a modern comprehensive customer journey that makes it easy for players to simply focus on playing their next game. Only then will they foster loyalty and expand their user base.

    "Five Fast Facts About Telehealth": "The State of Telehealth Today It’s experiencing skyrocketing growth —for an already-major industry.

    "The Secret Sauce Of Success Align With Company Goals": "It’s hard not to smile while having a conversation with Albertha Turner —not only because of her sunny and curious personality but also because she so obviously cares for others. To her being a mentor is an integral part of her daily life. You know the concept of “paying it forward”? Well that describes Albertha to the T. Even though you could say that Albertha fell into the training and development field it’s no accident that led her to her current role as VP Operations Training at Alorica. She’s someone who truly enjoys teaching people and seeing them succeed. Read her full Q&A below: Q: What was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your career? A: My strategy has been to always keep in touch with the company’s goals and initiatives. If we’re not aligned we’re not anything. I learned years ago that the purpose of training is to achieve a business result and you can only achieve that when you know the goals. I’ve done this throughout my career. Q: Did you ever work with a mentor and how did that process help you? A: I like to say that I’ve had many mentors even though they may not have known. If I see someone who has a talent trait or skill that I admire I’m going to get to know them. I will insert myself in their space and ask them to teach me. As you supervise people you should be their teacher and guide. If I know something I’m going to share it with you and my team. There’s no value in holding back information. The more we all know the more we can be successful together. Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? How did you face that challenge? A: As I look at challenges that I’ve had I try to not look at it from the perspective of “are you challenging me because I’m a female or a different race?” What I do is if someone is challenging me or doesn’t want to work with me I find out why. You’re going to work with all different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things. What are you going to do? You have to work through each issue. Q: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth? A: At Alorica this Women’s Initiative is very exciting. It’s wonderful that the company has taken this opportunity to say we need to do more we need to help to educate and grow our female work force. In my area I find the training field exciting. Even though I fell into this position it was definitely a great fit for me. It fit my natural tendencies which is to want to see people succeed. In training you get the satisfaction of seeing someone on the operations floor being successful. I love investing in each person. Q: How important is it to have a career plan? How often do you outline your personal career goals? A: I look at where I am generally in December or January. I’m a linear person and I do things in a timeline. I look back at the goals I made last year. Did I meet them how close did I get and should I realign them? I do checks along the way to make sure I’m on track throughout the year. There are times when life happens personal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course. Then you have to look at your original goal and ask if that’s the right one to have. A goal is just that—it’s a point of direction but you have to be flexible enough to take detours.",
