            href="http://www.alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted global leader in
            next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions, has received its third Silver Stevie&amp;reg; Award for
            Minority-Owned Business of the Year. This marks Alorica's fifth accolade in this supplier diversity
            category, underscoring the company's longtime dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;amp;I)
            as part of its core differentiators. Alorica
            previously won the Bronze Stevie&amp;reg; in 2018 and 2019 before securing the coveted Silver Stevie&amp;reg;
            in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Stevie win comes as Alorica celebrates 24 years in the
            industry. &lt;i&gt;"When we started Alorica in 1999 as a family-owned business, embracing diversity and
            promoting inclusivity were&amp;mdash;and still are&amp;mdash;an integral part of who we are,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;said
            Alorica&amp;rsquo;s Founder and Executive Chairman Andy Lee.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;DE&amp;amp;I are
            not only the right areas to prioritize, but they&amp;rsquo;re also critical components in building a global
            business. It&amp;rsquo;s important to us that we&amp;rsquo;re making a difference for our customers,
            employees as well as our communities.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a certified
            Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Alorica
            stands alongside 20% of U.S. businesses. The company's commitment to diversity resonates throughout its
            ranks, with almost 70% of
            its U.S. employees representing minority groups, and women comprising 60% of its global workforce. Alorica
            focuses on internal growth, with a majority of executive and leadership positions filled through promotions
            from within the company. In 2022,
            Alorica promoted over 5,000 employees, more than half of whom were women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For
            this award, the judging panel acknowledged Alorica&amp;rsquo;s key initiatives, such as its global DE&amp;amp;I
            program&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Together for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (TIDE)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;which
            received accolades for providing employees with a platform for discussion, education, and activism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall,
            Alorica garnered high praise from the esteemed panel during the 2023 award selection process. Judges
            commented:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left:60px;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alorica is an

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted leader in next-generation customer experience
            (CX) solutions, today announced its expansion plans into Africa and Europe through the launch of its

            outsourcers (BPO) globally with 100,000 employees across 17 countries and 24 years of CX experience&amp;mdash;Alorica
            continues to scale and diversify its best-in-class workforce, now with a presence in these new markets.
            Setting up operations in Egypt and Poland further enables the digital CX company to meet the growing

            through Africa and Europe is key to our strategy of offering culturally and linguistically relevant support

            Executive Officer at Alorica.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;Egypt and Poland have been on our radar as
            robust commercial markets with a strong talent pipeline. Our new operations will unlock career opportunities
            for local residents and create a distinct path to extend our solutions to clients in the region.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With
            the expansion into Egypt and Poland, Alorica continues its investment into high-growth markets with scalable

            its work-at-home and on-site programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cairo, Alorica&amp;rsquo;s new contact
            center is strategically located in Sheikh Zayed City near top private universities, while its site in &#321;&amp;oacute;d&#378;,

            scalable, cost-efficient and secure implementation. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many businesses are facing the challenge of needing to invest and scale more
            robust customer service and experience requirements amidst uncertain economic outlooks,&#8221; said Greg

            messaging, mobile applications and social platforms as part of the customer journey. In response, service
            models must deliver fast and easy customer engagement, across
            all channels, in a way that is both personalized and contextual at every customer touchpoint. However,
            companies are challenged to activate new technology, high-quality talent and world-class operational models
            at an accelerated pace while simultaneously

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Leading Analyst Firm Recognizes Alorica&#8217;s Ability to Deliver in Key Emerging
            Service Models&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IRVINE, California (January 28, 2021)&#8212;&lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,
            a global customer experience (CX) provider, has been identified as a Leader in NelsonHall&#8217;s 2021 NEAT
            vendor evaluation for
            Social Media CX Services for Content Moderation, Trust and Safety. This recognition highlights Alorica&#8217;s
            expertise in delivering social media customer experiences on behalf of clients including its wide range of
            offerings, globally scaled delivery
            capability, strong market presence and client benefits achieved, as well as its proven sustainability to
            meet future client requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In today&#8217;s always-on digital world, social media customer care,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="/outcomes/products/content-moderation/"&gt;content moderation&lt;/a&gt;, online reputation management
            and online fraud protection have become critical
            to the overall customer experience,&#8221; said Chris Crowley, Chief Commercial Officer at Alorica. &#8220;This
            acknowledgement from NelsonHall reaffirms the value of our best-in-class operating model of people, process
            and technology. We handle nearly

            protecting the trusted relationship between

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s positioning as a Leader in the Social Media CX Services NEAT assessment was based
            on specific strengths identified by NelsonHall, a leading global BPO and IT outsourcing analyst, including:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Strong content moderator engagement, wellbeing and resilience monitoring, and microlearning with
            proprietary tools&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Significant experience in social media customer care for consumer electronics and high-tech sector&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Market momentum and growth path in content moderation&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Strong capability for online reputation management services, including advertiser support and
            marketing back-office&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Strategic partnership with an online reputation management technology provider&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ivan Kotzev, CX Services Analyst, NelsonHall, said: &#8220;The exponential growth of user generated
            content and the rapid evolution of threats on social media platforms create a need for delivery improvement

        <description>&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Alorica will employ more than 91,000 people in 154 locations
            spanning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;16 countries across five continents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            class="p2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif. &lt;/strong&gt;&#8211; June 1, 2016 &#8211; Alorica Inc.
            (Alorica) has entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Expert Global Solutions (EGS) to form a new
            global customer experience organization. In 2015, these businesses generated
            an aggregate of approximately $2.3 billion in revenue. Going to market under the Alorica brand, the new
            Alorica will be staffed by 52,000 industry experts in North America (including 6,000 Work-at-Home employees)
            and more than 38,000 across the globe,
            with 26,300 based in the Philippines and 11,800 in Latin America. These professionals will be engaging
            customers in more than 30 languages in all channels. The combined company will integrate strengths from both
            companies with an emphasis on transforming
            the customer experience through data-driven insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Andy Lee, founder of
            Alorica, will be CEO and Chairman of the new organization, based in Irvine, Calif. He will also be the
            majority shareholder. &#8220;This blend of talent allows us to better serve customers because of our
            substantial global footprint,
            broad and deep vertical expertise and industry-leading solutions. More importantly, we share the same
            commitment to our people, passion for our clients and integrity in our business.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            class="p2"&gt;Bob Segert, President and Chief Executive Officer of EGS, addressed the acquisition, saying:
            &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of the transformation EGS has achieved in recent years. Our people have worked hard
            to earn the trust of our clients and become a valued
            service partner. The combination of our companies creates innovative capabilities to deliver world-class
            customer experiences, with an even broader suite of solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The new Alorica
            will serve more than 600 clients, supporting customers through every channel, including voice, mobile, chat,
            social media and video. For these and future clients, the timing of the acquisition is also critical.
            &#8220;Increasingly more
            companies are looking for industry-specific customer experience solutions,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;With our
            domain expertise in nine major verticals, particularly in healthcare, communications, retail and financial
            services, we&#8217;ll be well positioned
            to tailor the right mix of talent, capacity, analytics and technology to deliver solutions for every client.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            class="p2"&gt;This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory
            requirements. The companies expect to complete the transaction with regulators&#8217; approval by early Q3
            2016. When the transaction is finalized, the possibilities,
            says Lee, are endless: &#8220;Creating insanely great customer experiences that surpass expectations is what
            Alorica is all about. The new Alorica will make countless lives better across nearly every continent, one
            customer interaction at a time.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p2"&gt;EGS&#8217; shareholders will continue to

            DEI topics. In the first
            year, Alorica employees participated in more than 50 &lt;em&gt;Real Talk&lt;/em&gt; sessions around the
            globe including special fireside chats on key topics, such as Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQIA+ community.
            During these sessions, employees have the chance
            to listen, share personal experiences, ask questions, uplift one another and discuss ideas on how to make
            lives and communities better. Additionally, Alorica issues a quarterly TIDE newsletter to share insights and
            inspirational stories emanating
            from these group conversations. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been an incredible experience learning, growing and sharing as a
            community and family throughout the process of developing our TIDE program and the &lt;em&gt;Real Talk
            sessions&lt;/em&gt;,&#8221; said Alorica&#8217;s Chief Culture Officer Joyce
            Lee. &#8220;DEI is engrained in our culture and part of who we are. So, we are proud to be recognized for
            our grassroots initiatives, but the work is far from done and we&#8217;re just getting started.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR Daily&#8217;s 2021 Nonprofit Communications Awards recognize the engaging and powerful
            communications efforts from the past year. Program winners represent the people, teams and organizations
            whose powerful storytelling and campaigns, partnerships
            and projects helped build awareness of, or raise funds for important causes, initiatives, organizations and
            programs. &amp;nbsp;

            leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions, earned the Silver Stevie&#174; Award for
            Minority-Owned Business of the Year. This is the fourth Stevie Awards recognition for Alorica in this
            category, highlighting the company&#8217;s
            ongoing focus on, and leadership in, DE&amp;amp;I (diversity, equity &amp;amp; inclusion) initiatives. The
            win also affirms Alorica&#8217;s alignment with clients&#8217; desire and commitment to source from diverse
            suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a minority-owned business, celebrating
            diversity and promoting inclusivity are an integral part of who we are,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;
            noted &lt;b&gt;Andy Lee, Alorica Founder and Executive Chairman.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;From the top
            down, we value the variety of ideas and perspectives our diverse workforce brings to the table, which
            contributes to better outcomes for our clients and their customers.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica
            is certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by the National Minority Supplier Development&amp;nbsp;Council
            (NMSDC). According to the 2021&amp;nbsp;Annual Business Survey&amp;nbsp;(ABS), nearly 20% of employer
            businesses in the U.S. are minority-owned,
            earning $1.5 trillion in annual receipts. In addition to minority ownership, 72% of Alorica&#8217;s U.S.
            employees today come from traditionally underrepresented groups, and 61% of its total global workforce is
            made up of women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Alorica is a proud minority-owned
            business making a substantial impact on the U.S. economy and creating jobs for a diverse pool of candidates,&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;stated
            &lt;b&gt;Greg Haller, Alorica CEO. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;We view this designation as
            a competitive differentiator. Not only are we well equipped to understand the challenges of other diverse
            businesses, but we also leverage our DE&amp;amp;I focus to best support our employees and customers, while
            making a positive social impact on our local communities.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            2022 Stevie Award honors Alorica&#8217;s outstanding achievements as a minority-owned business, and its goal
            to make lives better through more than 2 billion positive customer interactions annually. A family-founded
            company that embraces grassroots
            DE&amp;amp;I through its global program TIDE (Together for Inclusion, Diversity &amp;amp; Equity), Alorica
            has hosted more than 120 &lt;i&gt;Real Talks &lt;/i&gt;since its inception. These interactive discussions
            have covered social issues that matter most to its employees
            including topics, such as gender stereotypes, racism, unconscious bias, veterans &amp;amp; military
            families, people with disabilities, mental health and the LGBT+ community. The company strives to deliver
            exceptional employee and customer experiences
            possible by creating a welcoming and empathetic environment where people can share, learn and grow together.
            As a result, Alorica has achieved record high employee satisfaction scores of over 83% by prioritizing
            employee engagement and confidence
            across its global workforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past year, Alorica has achieved key industry

            Funding, Charity Collaboration and Resource Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IRVINE, Calif &#8211;
            Oct. 7, 2021&lt;/b&gt;&#8212;&lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,
            a&#8239; &lt;a href="/awards-recognition"&gt;global leader in digital customer experience (CX) solutions&lt;/a&gt;,
            announced today that its Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee and non-profit partner &lt;a
            href="https://livesbetter.org/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt;(MLBA),
            have been named a Silver winner in the 18th annual Stevie&#174; Awards
            for Women in Business, recognized for &#8220;Most Valuable Non-Profit Response&#8221;. Lee was honored for
            leading MLBA&#8217;s efforts to provide pandemic relief through a culture of connection and empowerment,
            spanning grant donations, charity support
            and resource assistance. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alorica&#8217;s program was a standout among this year&#8217;s entries,
            demonstrating tremendous work and support for those impacted by the pandemic,&#8221; said Maggie Gallagher
            Miller, President of the Stevie&#174; Awards. &#8220;This campaign
            not only reached a large number of people, but empowered Alorica&#8217;s staff to make a true difference in
            their communities. Making Lives Better with Alorica is a remarkable endeavor to be encouraged.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Founder and President of MLBA&#8212;a nonprofit led by Alorica employees&#8212;Lee
            initiated COVID-19 relief efforts to help recipients with essential needs, such as rent, water and utilities
            to prevent homelessness as well as to cover costs for
            medical care, groceries, sanitary supplies and funeral expenses for those who tragically lost loved ones. In
            2020, the nonprofit raised nearly $867,000 in monetary donations, awarded 924 grants totaling $527,000,
            assisted 400+ families through crisis
            relief efforts, and supported 68 charities globally. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLBA was also recognized for directly supporting a number of charities and organizations
            in the fight against COVID-19. This includes WeNeedMasks.org to combat supply shortages of PPE; Catchafire,
            where Aloricans could virtually volunteer with other nonprofits;
            the Red Cross to attract volunteers to donate blood; and Second Harvest Food Bank to host food
            distributions, &lt;a href="https://livesbetter.org/charities-and-organizations-helping-to-fight-covid-19/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;among other organizations&lt;/a&gt;.
            Additionally, Lee led the charge in organizing an online information center for resources to help those in
            need take care of themselves, their families and their communities. This portal included federal, state,
            local and Alorica corporate assistance
            for necessities like food, utilities, unemployment benefits and healthcare. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People turn to MLBA when they have nowhere else to go for help and unfortunately
            the pandemic became one of those situations for many people around the world,&#8221; shared Lee. &#8220;I&#8217;m
            grateful that Alorica and MLBA were able to play
            a role in providing essential funds, critical resources and hope during these times. I&#8217;m constantly
            inspired and in awe of people&#8217;s generosity, kindness, creativity and humanity especially when it
            matters most. This award is a recognition
            to all the #MLBAHeroes who contributed to make a difference.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stevie&#174; Awards for Women in Business honor women executives, entrepreneurs,

            management outsourcing solutions, today announced that it has completed its acquisition of several of West

            Acquiring West's agent services businesses broadens Alorica's product offerings and market reach, enhances
            the company's delivery
            capabilities and allows Alorica to continue its sustained, aggressive growth on a global scale. With the
            acquisition, Alorica now offers its clients:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Increased global footprint&lt;/b&gt; with
            further presence in the US, Latin America and the Philippines. Alorica now has 73 locations, including the
            addition of sites in Mexico and Jamaica. Alorica's employee base has more than doubled
            to approximately 48,000 employees worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work at home agents&lt;/b&gt;,
            consisting of approximately 5,000 employees, allow Alorica clients to expand the need for just-in-time
            staffing for rapid deployments, unpredictable volumes, seasonal ramps, or other flexible resourcing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healthcare
            Solutions&lt;/b&gt;, providing a full suite of back office, support, and sales functions including pharmacy
            and licensed insurance capabilities&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Center of Analytical

            agent services businesses provide large-scale customer contact solutions to a wide range of vertical

            to complete the transaction. Wells Fargo Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to Alorica. McGuire
            Woods LLP acted as legal counsel to Alorica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today is an
            exciting day for Alorica. Our acquisition of West's agent services businesses underscores our commitment to
            strategic and rapid company growth to better support our clients' needs," said Andy Lee, CEO, Alorica."The
            expansion of our geographical
            presence, market reach and service offerings allows Alorica to deliver immediate value to our clients and
            their customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a global customer experience (CX)
            provider, announced today that it has been

            are honored to be recognized as an industry leader, and in our opinion, attribute it to our forward-thinking
            business strategy and operational excellence,&#8221; said Andy Lee, CEO of Alorica. &#8220;Starting off with
            a clear vision is critical,

            accelerated adoption of transformative service models, we will continue to invest in optimizing our

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ability to Execute, Alorica was positioned the highest, which according to Gartner,
            &#8220;summarizes factors such as the vendor&#8217;s financial viability, market responsiveness, product
            development, sales channels and customer base.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

            Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a
            wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in
            markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four
            quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. BPOs were evaluated based on 15 criteria

            strategy, product/service, operations and innovation among others. The research enables companies to get the
            most from market analysis in alignment with their unique business and technology needs. &amp;nbsp;

            Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted global leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions, has received
            its third Silver Stevie&#174; Award for
            Minority-Owned Business of the Year. This marks Alorica's fifth accolade in this supplier diversity
            category, underscoring the company's longtime dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;amp;I)
            as part of its core differentiators. Alorica
            previously won the Bronze Stevie&#174; in 2018 and 2019 before securing the coveted Silver Stevie&#174; in
            2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Stevie win comes as Alorica celebrates 24 years in the
            industry. &lt;i&gt;"When we started Alorica in 1999 as a family-owned business, embracing diversity and
            promoting inclusivity were&#8212;and still are&#8212;an integral part of who we are,&#8221; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;said
            Alorica&#8217;s Founder and Executive Chairman Andy Lee.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;DE&amp;amp;I are not only
            the right areas to prioritize, but they&#8217;re also critical components in building a global business. It&#8217;s
            important to us that we&#8217;re making a difference for our customers, employees as well as our
            communities.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)
            by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Alorica stands alongside 20% of U.S.
            businesses. The company's commitment to diversity resonates throughout its ranks, with almost 70% of
            its U.S. employees representing minority groups, and women comprising 60% of its global workforce. Alorica
            focuses on internal growth, with a majority of executive and leadership positions filled through promotions
            from within the company. In 2022,
            Alorica promoted over 5,000 employees, more than half of whom were women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For
            this award, the judging panel acknowledged Alorica&#8217;s key initiatives, such as its global DE&amp;amp;I

            Alorica garnered high praise from the esteemed panel during the 2023 award selection process. Judges
            commented:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#8220;Alorica is an impressive
            company that focuses on delivering digital customer experiences while prioritizing diversity and inclusion.&#8221;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;The International Association of Outsourcing Professionals Includes Alorica in its Annual
            Global Outsourcing 100 List&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif. &#8211; (Feb. 18, 2020)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&#8211;
            &lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in customer experience
            solutions, today announced it has earned a spot on the 2020 Best
            of The Global Outsourcing 100 (GO100) list for the sixth consecutive year. The annual list, presented by the
            International Association of Outsourcing Providers (IAOP), identifies the world&#8217;s best outsourcing
            service providers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the outsourcing industry is constantly evolving, we continue to position
            ourselves as a partner of choice by leveraging our high-performing people, innovative technologies, proven
            processes and global expertise,&#8221; said Greg Haller, Chief
            Operating Officer at Alorica. &#8220;The inclusion on the GO100 is a testament to Alorica&#8217;s commitment
            to customer experience excellence. Thank you to IAOP for the recognition and validation.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging for The GO100 is based on a rigorous scoring methodology that includes an
            independent review by a panel of IAOP customer members with extensive experience in selecting outsourcing
            service providers and advisors for their organizations. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies that outsource, not only in the traditional sense but also through the
            wide array of the ever-changing collaborative business models, are scrutinizing their providers very
            closely, which is why choosing the right partners is more important
            than ever,&#8221; said Debi Hamill, IAOP CEO. &#8220;The GO100 is the definitive guide to help companies
            research and compare service providers with whom they are considering relationships." &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For companies who turn to IAOP for guidance on their outsourcing strategy, Alorica&#8217;s
            consistent presence on the GO100 list is a reflection of our 20+ year legacy of providing insanely great

            commercial markets with a strong talent pipeline. Our new operations will unlock career opportunities for
            local residents and create a distinct path to extend our solutions to clients in the region.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With

            continue to leverage its innovative technologies to engage employees and customers through a combination of
            its work-at-home and on-site programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cairo, Alorica&#8217;s new contact
            center is strategically located in Sheikh Zayed City near top private universities, while its site in &#321;&#243;d&#378;,

            Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;global
            leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently

            data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;2022 MLBA Impact Report&lt;/a&gt;,
            highlighting a year of non-profit partnerships, grassroots fundraising and crisis relief. Alorica&#8217;s
            support of MLBA is part of an ongoing commitment to empower employees to lead the company&#8217;s &lt;a
            href="http://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate Social
            Responsibility&lt;/a&gt; (CSR) initiatives, which includes programs under three pillars&#8212;People,
            Philanthropy and Planet. In 2022, 44% of eligible Alorica employees donated to MLBA, raising nearly $600,000
            and awarding over 1,000 grants that totaled $800,000 to help
            team members, their families, communities and other local nonprofits around the world. When Hurricane Ian
            struck South Florida and Typhoon Noru hit the Philippines, Aloricans banded together to donate over $40,000
            to help victims rebuild their
            lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among
            MLBA&#8217;s accomplishments in 2022 are earning Candid&#8217;s coveted Platinum Seal of Transparency
            for the second year in a row&#8212;the highest level of recognition awarded to organizations
            who demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility and transparency
            for donors worldwide. MLBA also expanded NextGen, its program for youth
            volunteers, to Guatemala, Mexico and Panama. NextGen inspires a spirit for
            giving in the future generation as well as teaches them valuable business
            skills as they lead their own charitable projects. MLBA gave $60,000 through
            its Inspiration Fund enabling 71 students, ages 11-18, to pursue their
            educational dreams by taking coding classes, purchasing laptops, attending
            dance camps and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
            addition to fulfilling individual grants, Alorica employees work together to
            identify and raise money for local nonprofits that benefit causes that matter
            most to them. MLBA Alphaland in the Philippines partnered with the Kanlong
            Foundation, an NGO that serves children with disabilities, to sponsor 20 of
            their scholars with school supplies and hygiene kits. Our Puebla Chapter in
            Mexico put on a play to create awareness for violence against women and raised nearly
            $800 in funds to donate to the National Association Against Human Trafficking
            in Society. In Canada, MLBA Montreal supported a local charity called &#8220;The
            Welcome Collective&#8221; for a winter clothing donation drive to assist refugee
            families from Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, Colombia, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s
            incredible to see what Alorica has accomplished through MLBA in 2022 and for the past 8 years since we
            started,&#8221;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;said Joyce Lee, Alorica&#8217;s Chief Culture Officer and MLBA&#8217;s
            President.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;I am extremely proud of the Alorica volunteers who have led our
            grassroots efforts to raise nearly $8 million, award over 12,000 grants and support 100+ charities since
            MLBA&#8217;s inception. The company&#8217;s unique approach to CSR is made possible because of our employees&#8217;
            compassion, tenacity and resourcefulness. They know their people and the local needs better than anyone.
            Through our culture of connection and empowerment, Alorica has been able to give to many communities in the
            most meaningful way. We&#8217;re excited to continue sharing the love this year and beyond.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica
            is MLBA&#8217;s primary sponsor, providing administrative resources, logistics and personnel costs required
            to fuel the nonprofit. In turn, MLBA is an integral part of Alorica&#8217;s larger commitment to CSR, which
            champions programs that align with the company&#8217;s vision of making lives better, one interaction at a
            time&#174;. For information on how to contribute or partner with MLBA, visit &lt;a

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in customer experience solutions
            and CCW&#8217;s &lt;a
            href="/news/detail/alorica-named-bpo-of-the-year-at-worlds-largest-customer-contact-event/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;BPO of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the company&#8217;s expansive operations
            in the Philippines.
            The report highlights unparalleled strengths in developing talent, scaling operations, creating a unique
            culture and exceeding customer quality metrics. As the third largest customer experience provider in the
            country with 19 delivery locations and
            38,000 employees in the Philippines alone, Alorica has expertly leveraged the local talent pool, leading
            technologies, modern infrastructure and strong communication skills to enhance its global service delivery.
            &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ingredients that are baked into Alorica Philippines&#8217; DNA, make it an
            excellent choice for customer care, financial solutions, tech support, revenue generation and omnichannel
            solutions,&#8221; said Michael DeSalles, Principal Analyst
            at Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan. &#8220;The Alorica Philippines team is highly educated&#8212;90 percent of
            company employees have earned a college degree and have excellent English skills. It&#8217;s perfect for
            providing exceptional, or &#8216;insanely
            great,&#8217; end-to end services to customers across all industries.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DeSalles, Alorica Philippines serves the needs of the world&#8217;s best
            brands through the following differentiators:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation in Agent Hiring&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; An automated
            chatbot for recruiting manages 7,000 to 10,000 interactions per month, meeting scalability demands and
            reducing cost-per-hire by 84%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing the &#8220;Super&#8221; Agent&lt;/strong&gt;
            &#8211; Through deploying tools like microlearning and gamification, Alorica builds high-quality talent fast
            and improves CSAT through engaging tools that appeal to their millennial employee
            base. The report cites results including reduced training time by 80% and improved CSAT gain at 15% for a
            retail client.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Focus on the Employee Experience&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211;
            From onboarding to career growth opportunities, Alorica prioritizes its people. Strategic onboarding and
            career development programs have led to industry leading attrition rates. In fact,
            75% of the Filipino leaders at Alorica began their careers as agents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering
            the Alorica Community&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; &lt;a href="http://www.livesbetter.org" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Making

            our special culture and high-quality environment that make us Alorica here in the Philippines,&#8221; said
            Bong Borja, President of Asia-Pacific Operations at Alorica. &#8220;It all starts from the moment you
            attract a candidate, the
            way you hire and develop them, all the way through to how they provide the best experience to our clients&#8217;
            customers. That&#8217;s why we are committed to making strategic investments in our people as well as the
            technologies and processes that

            Communications and Top Places to Work Awards.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Alorica was honored for its leading &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility"&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;
            (CSR) initiative dedicated to making lives better for its employees and their communities. As part of its
            CSR, the global CX provider empowers employees to engage in interactive social discussions, support local
            causes and take control of their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key to Alorica&#8217;s continued growth and success for the last 23 years is its
            unparalleled commitment to the employee experience,&#8221; said Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer at
            Alorica. &#8220;The best way to ensure exceptional service to our clients is by taking care of our people
            first. But it goes beyond that&#8212;it&#8217;s the right thing to do. That&#8217;s why we offer development
            programs at every level, ask local teams to identify causes and individuals &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want
            to support in their communities and encourage Aloricans around the world to talk about issues that impact
            them the most. With our eNPS (employee satisfaction score) reaching 79 last quarter, exceeding the
            world-class standard of 70, we are committed to maintaining our reputation as the top place to work for our
            current and future employees.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Winning companies were selected based on their initiatives to champion a diverse workforce and
            provide resources and support to help employees grow and succeed in their careers. The judges recognized
            Alorica for &#8220;hosting &lt;em&gt;Real Talk&lt;/em&gt; sessions to explore sensitive topics, supporting a
            nonprofit giving back to employees&#8217; communities and offering talent development for its entire
            workforce, making it a Top Place to Work in Ragan&#8217;s Employee Communications and Top Places to Work
            Awards.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

            Inclusion, Diversity and Equity), serves as a cornerstone for the entire employee experience. TIDE&#8217;s
            &lt;em&gt;Real Talk&lt;/em&gt; sessions provide a forum for Aloricans to come together and discuss social
            issues that are important to them and their communities; topics include gender bias, sexual orientation,
            discrimination and dismantling stereotypes. With more than 61% of its global workforce being women and
            nearly 72% of its US team made up of minorities, diversity is celebrated and encouraged across the
            organization. Aloricans also have the decision-making power to donate to local causes and fellow employees
            and their families in need through the company&#8217;s employee-led non-profit partner &lt;a&gt;Making Lives
            Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt; (MLBA), which has raised more than $7.3 million since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s our people who make Alorica a Top Place to Work,&#8221; added Alorica&#8217;s
            Chief Culture Officer &amp;amp; MLBA President Joyce Lee. &#8220;It&#8217;s our employees&#8217; ideas,
            diverse backgrounds and collective commitment to doing good, not only for their careers but also for their
            communities, that make us insanely great.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt;
            training and leadership development program, Alorica Academy, includes career pathing and development where
            employees can see where they are headed in their professional journey and even view the various tracks they
            can take depending on their interests and skills. This creates a clearer vision for their future at the
            company and allows employees to explore other areas beyond their current roles, resulting in increased
            employee satisfaction and lower attrition rates. Additionally, Alorica provides leadership skills training
            for all levels from onboarding to continuing education. This helps the company to promote leaders from
            within&#8212;just last quarter, Alorica promoted over 2,000 employees globally.&lt;/p&gt;

            business, &lt;a href="/home"&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in customer experience solutions,
            announced today it has been recognized
            for its customer service excellence with three honors at the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; annual Stevie
            Awards for Sales &amp;amp; Customer Service, one of the world&#8217;s leading business awards programs.
            &amp;nbsp; Alorica earned awards in three categories:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Customer Service or Call Center Consulting Practice of the Year&lt;/i&gt;
            &#8211; &lt;b&gt;GOLD&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; Transitioning employees from an in-house environment to an external
            services provider can be daunting, but Alorica&#8217;s unique methodology,
            which helps navigate cultural expectations, comply with regulations and optimize processes for greater
            efficiency, aims to achieve mutual success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Customer Service or Call Center
            Training Practice of the Year&lt;/i&gt; &#8211; &lt;b&gt;SILVER&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; In the contact center
            environment, change is the only constant. As customers become increasingly tech-savvy and expect greater
            interaction
            with, and support from, their favorite brands, it&#8217;s imperative to develop a workforce that exceeds
            expectations. Alorica does just that through microlearning, advanced analytics and modern technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contact
            Center or Customer Service Outsourcing Provider of the Year&lt;/i&gt; &#8211; &lt;b&gt;BRONZE&lt;/b&gt;
            &#8211; Alorica is constantly innovating, questioning and discovering new ways to make lives better. In 2018
            we achieved great success as
            a business including worldwide growth in the U.S., Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and investments in
            technology to create more value for clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re honored to be
            recognized for our excellence in customer service through the Stevie Awards,&#8221; said Greg Haller, Chief
            Operating Officer at Alorica. &#8220;As an industry leader in this space, Alorica continues to mine new
            opportunities
            to deepen relationships and align client needs with our innovative capabilities. These accolades are a
            testament to the success we&#8217;ve had in building strategic partnerships that maximize our clients&#8217;
            businesses.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stevie Awards for Sales &amp;amp; Customer Service are the world&#8217;s top honors
            for customer service, contact center, business development, and sales professionals. The Stevie Awards

            awards programs, including the prestigious American Business Awards&lt;sup&gt;&#174; &lt;/sup&gt;and
            International Business Awards&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif., May 19, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&#8212;&lt;a href="/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc&lt;/a&gt;., a global leader in customer experience solutions, has
            been named a Silver winner in the 2021 Stevie&#174; Awards for Minority-Owned Business of the
            Year. As the largest minority-owned business process outsourcing (BPO) provider in the world, Alorica is
            certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by both the National Minority Supplier Development Council
            and Southern California Minority
            Supplier Development Council. Recognition by the Stevies affirms Alorica&#8217;s alignment with clients&#8217;
            goals to hire and source from diverse and minority-owned companies. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This commendation by the Stevies highlights important company milestones as we
            continue to develop a diverse, inclusive and equitable workforce. I&#8217;m proud to share that more than
            60% of our employees is made up of women and nearly 70% of
            our US workforce is comprised of minorities,&#8221; said Andy Lee, Chairman and CEO of Alorica. &#8220;Our
            people are everything, and we believe there is unity in diversity. As part of our company culture, we
            embrace inclusivity and camaraderie and
            will continue to empower and learn from our employees to make lasting change in the world.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 program marks Alorica&#8217;s third Stevie Awards win in this category. This
            year&#8217;s recognition honors Alorica&#8217;s outstanding achievements as a minority-owned business,
            including the establishment of &lt;a href="/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;TIDE&lt;/a&gt;,
            a grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) program that is now an integral part of the company&#8217;s
            global employee experience. Through TIDE&#8217;s ongoing Real Talk series, employees at all levels have
            an interactive forum to increase awareness, share experiences and develop creative solutions to social
            issues in our communities. TIDE was introduced in 2020 under Alorica&#8217;s global &lt;a
            href="/corporate-social-responsibility/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;
            program, which is anchored in Philanthropy, People and Planet.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Stevie Award is among several accolades Alorica has received since last year.
            The company was distinguished as an &lt;a

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;global leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions&lt;/a&gt;,
            today announced its latest industry recognition&#8212;&#8220;Best Use of Technology in Customer Service&#8221;
            in the &lt;a href="https://stevieawards.com/sales/2022-stevie-award-winners" rel="nofollow"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;2022 Stevie Awards&lt;/a&gt;&#8212;for
            its employee engagement digital solutions. This acknowledgment affirms Alorica&#8217;s ability to attract,
            develop and retain best-in-class talent globally and at scale. By taking a continuous, data-driven approach
            to enriching employee development,
            Alorica&#8217;s comprehensive portfolio of products, processes and technologies help leading brands execute
            on innovative CX strategies that achieve optimal business outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New employee
            onboarding often lacks engagement and clarity, a process made even more difficult by the shift to a
            work-at-home labor force. With a focus on &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/continuity/workforce-optimization" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;workforce
            optimization&lt;/a&gt;,
            Alorica developed a digital, gamified web and mobile app &#8212; Alorica Connect &#8212; to create an
            engaging and accessible culture of connection with its 100,000 global employees, gather their feedback, and
            easily provide useful information right
            from the start. Connect supplies personal support to team members at scale, drives management decisions, and
            provides real-time transparency on performance, while building speed-to-proficiency and validating employee
            confidence. The app also captures
            and aggregates feedback on a broad range of listening posts to best understand how to drive desired results.
            More than 500,000 measurement touchpoints from Alorica&#8217;s employees worldwide have been converted into
            actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustaining this ongoing employee feedback loop is Hypercare, a
            comprehensive process fueled by analysis from Connect and other milestone surveys that improve performance
            and retention. Hypercare metrics unveil insights at individual, site and corporate
            levels to inform joint action plans focused on the most impactful areas of the employee experience. This
            approach creates better results in KPI, revenue and customer satisfaction for Alorica&#8217;s clients. Since
            its inception, Hypercare has increased
            the company&#8217;s employee satisfaction score, which was 79 last quarter, against the world-class standard
            of 70. The company has also seen an improvement of over 26% in attrition rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delivering
            insanely great customer experiences requires first creating an equally impressive environment for our
            employees,&#8221; said Chief Administrative Officer Colleen Beers. &#8220;Our employees are those closest to
            the customer. So, their
            experience, performance and recommendations are crucial elements to helping Alorica listen, engage, improve
            and innovate for our clients. It is this consultative approach, powered by digital-first solutions, that
            allows us to achieve operational excellence
            and anticipate the future needs of our internal and external stakeholders.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a

            Place to Work&#174; Institute. Companies receive Great Place to Work&#174; certification
            based on the experience and sentiment of their employees in five key areas: credibility, respect, fairness,
            pride, and fellowship. This year, 81% of employees said Alorica Philippines is a great place to work,
            compared to 53% at the typical global
            company. This award builds on the company&#8217;s first Great Place to Work&#174; recognition in Guatemala
            last year.&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It's a tremendous honor to add another Great Place to Work
            certification across our delivery markets,"&lt;/i&gt; said &lt;b&gt;Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer of
            Alorica.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;For over 20 years, our unique workplace culture has been foundational to
            our high performance, business resiliency and transformational change. This is a testament to our talented
            teams who allow us to achieve operational excellence in our service delivery. The Great Place to Work
            certification reflects Alorica&#8217;s standing as a leading global organization and gives our clients
            confidence that they have the best, brightest and most satisfied employees supporting their customers around
            the world.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when the global job
            market is experiencing high employee dissatisfaction, turnover and burnout&#8212;along with the Great
            Resignation reaching new heights in the US&#8212;Alorica remains steadfast in its commitment to the employee
            experience
            through recognition programs, ongoing feedback channels, digital support tools and Corporate Social
            Responsibility initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;This
            recognition is especially meaningful because it's based on direct feedback from our employees,"&lt;/i&gt;
            said &lt;b&gt;Bong Borja, Chief Operating Officer at Alorica.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;"We take great pride in the
            results&#8212;90% shared that Alorica is a physically safe place to work; 88% said they are made to feel
            welcomed when they join and 85% feel a sense of pride in what we accomplish. Our 55,000-strong team in the
            Philippines contributes significantly to Alorica&#8217;s success in the Asia-Pacific region&#8212;proof that
            our outstanding culture leads to high employee satisfaction and performance sustainable at a global level.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great
            Place to Work&#174; is the global authority on workplace culture, employee experience, and the leadership
            behaviors proven to deliver market-leading revenue, employee retention and increased innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Great
            Place to Work Certification&#8482; isn&#8217;t something that comes easily &#8211; it takes ongoing
            dedication to the employee experience,&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; said &lt;b&gt;Sarah Lewis-Kulin, Vice President of
            Global Recognition at Great Place to Work.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the only official
            recognition determined by employees&#8217; real-time reports of their company culture. Earning this
            designation means that Alorica Philippines is one of the best companies to work for in the country.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
            Great Place to Work&#174; recognition joins several other recent accolades Alorica has earned for its

            href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="/awards-recognition"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;global leader in customer experience (CX) solutions&lt;/a&gt;,
            today announced the addition of Mike Clifton as Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer
            (CIO). Clifton assumes responsibility for the company&#8217;s global information technology (IT)
            organization and initiatives, overseeing the design
            and delivery of digital technologies and strategies for Alorica&#8217;s continued success. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mike is a proven leader in digitization with a passion for innovation and creating
            solutions that drive results for clients,&#8221; said Andy Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Alorica. &#8220;With
            a breadth of experience across IT, operations and
            sales, he will play a key role in advancing Alorica&#8217;s mission to transform the next generation of
            omnichannel customer experiences.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifton has over 30 years of experience in software, technology, operations and sales,
            having held CIO and CISO titles at numerous companies. He joins Alorica from Cognizant, one of the world&#8217;s
            leading professional services companies, where he served
            as both CIO and Chief Innovation Technology Officer. In these roles, Clifton led global IT, operations and
            data, in which he oversaw the design and implementation of digitization strategies, IT organizational
            models, new market growth, and service-level
            management. Prior to Cognizant, Clifton held C-level positions at Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Hanover
            Insurance Group, Nobilis Software and others. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If customer loyalty reflects a brand&#8217;s health, then CX management is the
            lifeblood of every corporate enterprise,&#8221; commented Clifton. &#8220;Alorica is known for innovating
            digital-first CX strategies and modernizing the customer journey
            across industries. As the company continues to expand, I could not be more thrilled to join the team.&#8221;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifton succeeds outgoing Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer Steve
            Phillips, who joined Alorica in 2018. Phillips brought a combination of strategic technology leadership and
            operational discipline during his time with the company
            and led the transformation of Alorica&#8217;s IT organization into a strategic asset for both the company
            and its clients. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under Steve&#8217;s leadership, Alorica made significant progress enhancing our
            security posture, aligning our business and clients&#8217; interests, and bringing forward new technology
            solutions that matter to our clients,&#8221; added Lee. &#8220;We
            are grateful for his many contributions and wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been an honor to lead Alorica&#8217;s IT organization for the last three
            years,&#8221; said Phillips. &#8220;Alorica is dedicated to delivering world-class CX solutions and it&#8217;s
            been inspiring to see the progress made by the Alorica
            team over the last few years to advance our IT platforms to deliver against that mission. Mike is the ideal
            successor to continue that advancement.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;trusted global provider of next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions&lt;/a&gt;,
            announced that it has received &lt;a href="https://candid.org/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Candid&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;
            (previously GuideStar) coveted Platinum
            Seal of Transparency for the second year in a row. This is the highest level of recognition awarded to
            charitable organizations that clearly present a five-year strategic plan and a financial report showing the
            consistent achievement of outlined goals.
            Candid highlights nonprofits that provide meaningful information including results to simplify the nonprofit
            evaluation process for potential donors. MLBA, which is largely run by Alorica employees as part of the CX
            company&#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate
            Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt; (CSR), was also recently named on &lt;a href="https://greatnonprofits.org/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;GreatNonprofits&lt;/a&gt;&#8217; 2022 Top-Rated List for receiving positive
            reviews from donors,
            grant recipients and board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#8220;I continue to be so proud
            and impressed by how Aloricans around the world come up with meaningful ways to give back to their
            communities through Alorica&#8217;s partnership with MLBA,&#8221; said MLBA President and Alorica Chief
            Culture
            Officer Joyce Lee. &#8220;These recognitions from Candid and GreatNonprofits further validate that what MLBA
            is doing makes a difference. Last year, we focused on a variety of initiatives&#8212;from creating awareness
            for breast cancer &amp;amp; preventive
            screenings to providing funds for middle/high school students to pursue their educational interests. We also
            gave to refugee families, animal shelters, senior homes and local schools among other groups. I want to also
            thank our donors, which include
            Alorica employees, clients, former grant recipients and other partners, for trusting us and supporting our
            mission to make lives better.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Alorica&#8217;s
            industry-leading culture empowers employees to make connections all across the globe and help drive the
            company&#8217;s CSR goals. As a result, thousands of individuals and families have been touched by MLBA. In
            the seven years
            since its inception, MLBA Chapters&#8212;led by Alorica employees&#8212;have raised over $7.62 million,
            awarded more than 12,000 grants and developed hundreds of charitable partnerships to help those in need and
            support their communities. Through
            grassroots fundraising and Alorica payroll contributions, MLBA Chapters continue to aid local causes of
            their choice. Grants have been awarded to provide for essential needs, such as housing and medical costs,
            utility bills and funeral expenses, as
            well as to support those affected by natural disasters, such as Hurricane Ian and Typhon Noru last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;ABOUT
            MAKING LIVES BETTER WITH ALORICA&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livesbetter.org/"&gt;Making Lives
            Better with Alorica (MLBA)&lt;/a&gt; is a nonprofit that takes the traditional approach to corporate
            philanthropy and turns it on its head. Instead of company headquarters at Alorica Inc.&#8212;a global
            customer experience provider&#8212;deciding where and how to make charitable contributions, Alorica
            employees are empowered to give to those in need at a local level within their own communities&#8212;allowing
            them to share the love with the people, and in the places, that matter most to them. With MLBA Chapters
            around the world, Alorica employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better
            through grants, fundraisers and volunteering&#8212;and 100% of funds raised by a Chapter stays within that
            Chapter. Alorica provides the administrative resources required to fuel this global nonprofit as part of its
            &lt;a href="http://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility"&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;
            (CSR). Since its inception in 2015, MLBA has raised more than $7.62 million worldwide. To learn more, check

            &lt;p&gt;Everest Group&#8217;s PEAK Matrix Assessments provide comparative evaluations of providers,

            evaluation of factors, including vision, capabilities/functionality, talent availability, market
            success/impact, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s Leader position in the PEAK Matrix Assessment highlights the company&#8217;s
            strategic approach in delivering for its diverse clientele and supporting its 100,000 employees. CEO Greg
            Haller elaborates, &#8220;As one of the largest digital CX providers in the world, being recognized in the
            first PEAK Matrix Assessment for the Americas is testimony to our success as an &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/outcomes"&gt;Outcomes as a Service (OaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provider and
            validates our continued investments into best-in-class talent, operational excellence and solution-focused
            playbooks.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Alorica, the placement is also a well-earned recognition of the company&#8217;s reputation for
            delivering digital CX innovation and strong leadership bench. As Haller explains, &#8220;By mining the data
            we gather from our 2+ billion interactions, we&#8217;re able to take action on the insights and drive
            transformation, enabling our clients&#8217; progressive businesses in this evolving marketplace. Being

            Marketing Officer Colson Hillier. &#8220;And what worked in a brick-and-mortar environment doesn&#8217;t
            necessarily translate
            in this new virtual world. So, we took our proven service blueprint process for improving CX and applied it
            to our own operations to create this new WAH delivery model. It&#8217;s an entirely new system derived from
            our big data learnings, unique
            culture and 17 years of WAH experience, and it&#8217;s been critical to transitioning nearly 70% of our
            global workforce to a distributed model while maintaining performance for clients.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The

            &lt;a href="/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt; Alorica Anywhere platform&lt;/a&gt;
            has been an important driver in the company&#8217;s WAH success, having re-engineered Alorica&#8217;s system
            to adapt to the &#8216;new norm&#8217;.
            This includes offering 100% virtual hiring, instructional design customized for WAH training, new
            agent-assist tools and real time performance dashboards. As a result of its launch, our WAH delivery yielded
            a 7% increase in eNPS (Employee Net Promoter
            Score), leading to improved attrition and fill rates, 6% better overall performance and 100% continuity of
            services for hundreds of clients across all industries. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re
            optimizing both the employee and customer experience through our digital platforms, data intelligence and
            ability to make calculated changes at every level throughout the organization. Our philosophy is to act on
            the feedback from agents
            who are closest to the customer and leverage technology to capture, interpret and use data from a broad
            range of &#8220;listening posts&#8221; including speech analytics, anomaly detection, eNPS and performance
            reports. We aggregate these signals
            and quickly troubleshoot issues through our AI-enabled platform to ensure confident employees are delivering
            exceptional performance while maintaining a positive culture in a digital environment,&#8221; explained
            Hillier. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-protected digital platforms for highly complex
            and confidential customer data, Alorica Anywhere touts world-class security that meets various industry
            standards and includes features like data masking, identity management, access-control
            desktops, secure payment transactions and more. Building on 17 years of experience in work-at-home delivery,
            the Alorica Anywhere platform is designed to enable agents to deliver advanced CX services with global

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IRVINE, Calif.&#8212; September 29, 2022,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted leader in
            next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions, today announced it has promoted Bong Borja to Chief
            Operating Officer as part of its global strategy to transform the organization and industry. Borja&#8212;who
            was Alorica&#8217;s President of Asia-Pacific (APAC) Operations for the past 10 years and widely known as a
            pioneer of the BPO industry in the Philippines&#8212;has deep experience and a proven track record of
            success, leading multinational teams to deliver best-in-class, digitally charged CX to progressive brands
            around the world. As the company continues down its path of up leveling its talent, technologies and service
            offerings, Borja will play an instrumental role in leading Alorica&#8217;s operations for its 100,000+
            workforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his elevated position as COO, Borja will oversee global operations
            across Asia-Pacific, Latin America &amp;amp; The Caribbean and North America. He will also continue to
            directly manage the APAC region&#8212;Alorica&#8217;s largest market with over 60,000 employees across four
            countries&#8212;until his successor as President of APAC Operations is named in Q4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;We
            are thrilled to elevate Bong into the role of COO,&#8221;&lt;/i&gt; said &lt;b&gt;Alorica&#8217;s CEO Greg
            Haller&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;i&gt;&#8220;As our industry becomes increasingly digital, consultative and globally
            focused, Bong&#8217;s trailblazer mentality will help us maintain our industry leadership. Bong&#8217;s
            passion for driving performance by prioritizing culture, innovation and a deep understanding of client
            objectives makes him a perfect fit for the position. I am excited to continue working with Bong to grow our
            business and deliver exceptional CX to our clients today and in the future.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s
            APAC region has been a growth engine for the company, hitting key milestones in performance, training,
            technology and service delivery. In the past six years, Alorica realized revenue growth of 77%, and doubled
            in headcount across the region. The organization also expanded into three new countries throughout the
            continent&#8212;China, Japan and India. Under Borja&#8217;s leadership, Alorica earned several notable
            recognitions including two Asia-Pacific Gold Stevie Awards for Innovation in Human Resources Management and
            Innovative Use of Technology in Human Resources in 2019. The same year, his team helped the company achieve
            a Silver Stevie for Customer Service Training Practice of the Year. Alorica&#8217;s APAC region has
            consistently led all markets in employee satisfaction scores.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m
            honored to take on this global leadership role at such an exciting time in the evolution of our business,&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;
            said &lt;b&gt;Borja&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;i&gt;&#8220;I look forward to continue innovating and executing with Greg
            and our executive leadership team to ensure we exceed our customers&#8217; needs, while empowering our
            employees&#8217; professional success.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr

            &lt;h4&gt;New Hybrid Contact Center and Work-at-Home Model Supports Local Economy While Addressing
            Increasing Demand for Talent Expansion and Business Continuity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRVINE, California (March
            25, 2021)&#8212;&lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc&lt;/a&gt;., a global leader in
            customer experience solutions, today announced its continued growth in &lt;a
            href="/insights/resource/alorica-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-fact-sheet/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Latin
            America &lt;/a&gt;(LATAM) by establishing a new contact center in Cali, Colombia. As Alorica scales and
            diversifies its world-class talent, Cali serves as the latest investment to provide clients across a variety
            of industries
            with next-generation solutions to exceed their CX needs. In the second quarter, Alorica plans to hire locals
            for both onsite and work-at-home positions.
            &lt;br&gt;&#8220;As we continue extending our global footprint, our growth in the LATAM market has never
            looked stronger,&#8221; said Brian Delaney, President of LATAM &amp;amp; Caribbean Operations at Alorica.
            &#8220;Expanding our presence to Colombia enables
            us to offer more premier CX services in both English and Spanish. Laying roots in the vibrant city of Cali
            bolsters our talent pool, allows more optionality to our clients, and enhances the impactful customer
            interactions we&#8217;ve been known to
            deliver for over 20 years.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica has more than 17 years of experience in LATAM and the Caribbean, already
            operating in seven countries including the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama
            and Uruguay. As an ideal growth engine, the region delivers bilingual
            talent, with physical proximity and cultural similarity to the U.S. and continues to attract clients focused
            on business continuity and resiliency, while remaining cost-efficient. The new presence in Colombia will
            expand Alorica&#8217;s in-demand
            nearshore operations and further its reputation as one of the largest customer service providers in the
            world.&lt;br&gt;As a recognized &lt;a href="/culture/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;customer service BPO
            leader&lt;/a&gt;, Alorica
            demonstrates its commitment to investing in its people by focusing on employee engagement and performance.
            Through constant evaluation of the employee Net Promotor Score (eNPS), coupled with &lt;a
            href="/awards-recognition/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;award-winning training programs&lt;/a&gt; and culture
            initiatives, Alorica strives to remain the &#8220;best place to work&#8221;. The results are increased
            employee satisfaction, lower attrition rates and leaders being promoted
            from within the company year over year. Leveraging its &lt;a href="/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;work-at-home solution&#8212;Alorica Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;&#8212;not only allows the
            company to provide further
            flexibility to clients, but also to employees. Through a versatile operating model, Alorica offers gamified
            digital tools including a mobile app to help agents hone their skills, improve KPIs and build confidence,
            while sharing real-time feedback
            at every stage of the employee lifecycle to ensure high-quality service delivery. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a family-founded and led, minority-owned business, our people are everything,&#8221;
            added Delaney. &#8220;Our dynamic company culture is made possible because we hire and develop talented
            Aloricans from diverse backgrounds and geographies.
            And as part of our &lt;a href="/corporate-social-responsibility/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;corporate
            social responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, impact sourcing remains among our highest priorities so we may also benefit
            the communities where
            our employees live and work. We&#8217;re looking forward to creating many jobs in Colombia.&#8221;
            &lt;br&gt;Alorica&#8217;s new call center is strategically located in the Palmetto Plaza Shopping Mall
            alongside the top universities in Cali. The location offers employees numerous onsite amenities including
            accessible transportation, public services,
            retail stores, and more, while providing maximum efficiency for both brick-and-mortar and work-at-home
            operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Alorica&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alorica is a global

            &lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif., April 6, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&#8212;Following the appointments of Greg
            Haller to Chief Executive Officer and Founder Andy Lee to Executive Chairman, &lt;a

            href="https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/"&gt;global leader in next-generation customer experience
            (CX) solutions,&lt;/a&gt; today announced several key leadership moves, advancing its strategic growth plan.
            With Chief Employee Experience Officer Susan Dumond retiring from her post, Colleen Beers, former President
            of North America and Europe Operations, has been named Chief Administrative Officer responsible for Employee
            Experience (HR function) to further enhance Alorica&#8217;s hiring, training, development and culture. Jay
            King will lead all North America Operations as President, an expansion of his previous role leading Alorica&#8217;s
            Financial Solutions. To support the growth of Alorica&#8217;s service delivery in Europe, the Middle East
            and Africa (EMEA), the company has tapped highly respected industry leader Matt Sims as its first President
            of EMEA Operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;&#8220;It truly is a pivotal moment in Alorica&#8217;s journey, and I have
            great confidence in this leadership team as we accelerate and innovate our business to deliver the outcomes
            that matter to our clients,&#8221; shared CEO Greg Haller. &#8220;On behalf of the company, I&#8217;d like
            to thank Susan for her leadership and significant contributions in supporting our people especially during
            these past few unprecedented years. And I want to congratulate Colleen and Jay on their new roles. Through
            their proven track records and embodiment of Alorica&#8217;s core values, these tenured leaders will
            continue to ensure we stay future ready. Looking ahead as we focus on growing our presence in EMEA, I am
            excited to welcome Matt to the Alorica family.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;Colleen Beers brings proven experience driving operational excellence and
            building Alorica&#8217;s award-winning culture and employee experience. In partnership with Beers, longtime
            BPO executive Jay King has continued to grow Alorica&#8217;s Financial Solutions line of business around the
            world. Together, Beers and King have led 30,000 employees and delivered record results in Alorica&#8217;s
            overall performance, employee satisfaction and digital solutions growth. With 20 years of experience in
            customer service and journey optimization, Matt Sims joins Alorica from the UK to expand the organization&#8217;s
            EMEA operations, providing scalable multilingual and omni-channel CX solutions. Previously, he served as the
            managing partner at 4T4 Intelligent Customer Solutions and held executive positions focused on the UK &amp;amp;
            South Africa regions for Teleperformance and Sykes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;&#8220;Leveraging the diverse and deep experience of our leadership team,
            we are well positioned to further boost our service delivery, efficiency and digital innovation, producing
            greater value to our customers and better support for our employees,&#8221; said Haller. &#8220;We&#8217;re
            off to a strong start this year, having recently being named a &lt;a

            CX provider&#8217;s digital foundry&#8212;to deliver outcome-based technology solutions that map and solve
            customer pain points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powered by Genesys&#8217; leading AI technology, Alorica
            offers smarter automation, personalization and optimization on behalf of some of the most progressive
            companies in the world. Currently, Genesys Cloud CX is supporting thousands of Alorica employees in
            delivering exceptional results for its first wave of global clients spanning diverse industries including
            fintech, retail, gaming, telecommunication, public sector and more. Some of these initial wins include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Established a more reliable Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)
            platform for a national media company with &lt;b&gt;100% availability &lt;/b&gt;from improved connectivity
            and a more efficient process to resolve issues quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successfully added digital
            channels to supplement voice services for a major telecommunication provider, giving &lt;b&gt;12,000+ B2B
            customers&lt;/b&gt; the ability to communicate seamlessly through their preferred channel on a single
            platform that supports all interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployed self-service AI tools to supplement
            voice and chat for after hours and added email capabilities on behalf of a well-known beauty &amp;amp; skin
            care company, which led to an &lt;b&gt;immediate 18% customer retention increase; &lt;/b&gt;next year&#8217;s
            plans include launching agent assist, generative AI voice and chat summaries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As
            more enterprises move to the cloud, many of our clients have come to us with the same three key priorities,&#8221;
            explained Alorica&#8217;s Chief Digital Officer Harry Folloder. &#8220;First, organizations need a reliable
            platform to support customers and employees globally without disruption. They also need to make digital
            channels easily accessible and integrated so customers can communicate how they want, when they want.
            Finally, they want to deploy AI solutions for a variety of support CX needs including self-service, virtual
            assistant and agent assist. These are the areas where Alorica IQ and Genesys can make the biggest impact
            together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many brands rely on their partnership with Alorica to bring innovative
            technology that helps them engage and build trust with their customers. Through Alorica&#8217;s partnership
            with Genesys, the digital CX provider can provide its clients the manpower, technology and vision to support
            their needs both now and in the future. Using Genesys Cloud CX&#8217;s extensive generative, conversation
            and predictive AI capabilities, Alorica enables clients to differentiate in market through intelligent
            self-service and automation, resulting in stronger human and bot-assisted experiences that drive customer
            satisfaction, while helping them improve operational efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to
            increased productivity and enhanced CX, Alorica&#8217;s transition to cloud from on-premises solutions is a
            major step toward reaching its sustainability goals as part of its Environmental, Social, and Governance
            (ESG) commitment. In fact, agents in the cloud can have a carbon footprint of up to nearly 10 times less
            than on-premises agents, according to &lt;a
            href="https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/e3/79/42bf75c94c279c67d777f002051f/carbon-reduction-opportunity-of-moving-to-aws.pdf"

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IRVINE, Calif.&#8212; September 15, 2022,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted global provider
            of next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions, has announced that two of its operational
            sites&#8212;St., Joseph, MO and Corpus Christi, TX&#8212;have each earned their first U.S. Environmental
            Protection Agency&#8217;s (EPA) ENERGY STAR&#174; certification for superior energy performance. On average,
            ENERGY STAR-certified buildings and
            plants use 35 percent less energy, cause 35 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions and are less expensive to
            operate than their peers&#8212;all without sacrificing performance or comfort. Over the next year, Alorica
            plans to certify additional sites
            and will perform energy audits at several of their buildings to ensure ongoing compliance and achievement of
            targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s building in St. Joseph received an ENERGY STAR score of 83,
            making it the most efficient Alorica building in North America. In April 2022, St. Joseph completed its
            light emitting diode (LED) retrofit project, resulting in annual electrical
            savings of $50,000 and energy reduction of 515,000 kWh, an equivalent to CO2 emissions from 41,068 gallons
            of gas consumed. Alorica&#8217;s Corpus Christi site received an ENERGY STAR score of 80, thanks to its
            installation of LED lighting and energy-efficient
            HVAC units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely proud of this recognition as we expand our
            presence in North America,&#8221;&lt;/i&gt; said &lt;b&gt;Jay King, President of Alorica&#8217;s North
            America Operations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;It represents our company-wide commitment to sustainability as
            part of our ESG initiatives. I applaud our energy management team for their continued focus on ensuring
            efficient operations that conserve energy while reducing costs. Taking care of one another and prioritizing
            sustainability efforts are equally important, and this is just one of the ways we show our dedication to our
            people and communities, both today and for future generations.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Improving
            the energy efficiency of our nation&#8217;s buildings is critical to protecting our environment,&#8221; &lt;/i&gt;said
            &lt;b&gt;Cindy Jacobs, Chief of the ENERGY STAR Commercial &amp;amp; Industrial Branch.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#8220;From
            the boiler room to the board room, organizations are leading the way by making their buildings more
            efficient and earning EPA&#8217;s ENERGY STAR certification."&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;font color="var(--color-h5)" size="-1"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica&#8217;s ESG approach
            (also known as CSR) is categorized under three pillars&#8212;Philanthropy, People and Planet. The Planet
            pillar focuses on sustainability and reducing carbon footprint and waste. Alorica prohibits practices that
            harm ecosystems
            and is always looking for ways to minimize the use of natural resources, while maintaining recycling
            programs around the world. Since 2019, the company experienced a total reduction of over 30 million kWh
            throughout the region due to a decrease in
            heating, cooling and electricity consumption. Additionally, it expanded its robust Work-at-Home program,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica
            Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, to further minimize
            impact on the environment by significantly reducing work commutes and the usage of office supplies globally.
            Alorica also continues to partner with specialized vendors to properly recycle e-waste. Since 2021, the
            company recycled 90 tons of waste
            through 19 of its sites and implemented a comprehensive GREENGUARD-certified Healthy High-Performance
            Cleaning (HHPC) program to&amp;nbsp;commit to using green, earth-friendly cleaning products. To learn more

            STAR Certification&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, the US Environmental
            Protection Agency&#8217;s ENERGY STAR program has identified the most energy-efficient products, buildings,
            plants, and new homes&#8212;all based on the latest government-backed standards. The program was created
            in 1992 to help businesses and individuals save energy and fight climate change. Today, every ENERGY STAR
            label is verified by a rigorous third-party certification process. ENERGY STAR certified buildings and
            plants are verified to perform in the
            top 25 percent of buildings nationwide, based on weather-normalized source energy use that considers
            occupancy, hours of operation, and other key metrics. ENERGY STAR is the only energy efficiency
            certification in the United States that is based on
            actual, verified energy performance. To date, tens of thousands of buildings and plants across all fifty
            states have earned the ENERGY STAR. For more information about ENERGY STAR for Buildings and Plants, visit

            Breakthrough AI Technology&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            IRVINE, Calif. &#8212; June 23, 2022 &#8212;&lt;/strong&gt; Alorica Inc.,&lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt; a trusted global leader in next-generation customer experience (CX)
            solutions,&lt;/a&gt; and Palo Alto-based &lt;a href="https://www.sanas.ai/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sanas&lt;/a&gt;,
            an artificial intelligence (AI) linguistic translation software developer, today announced a strategic
            partnership that offers revolutionary real-time accent translation capability to Alorica&#8217;s worldwide
            customer base. As Sanas&#8217; strategic CX services partner, Alorica will deploy this groundbreaking AI
            technology to effectively navigate the challenges of dialects and accents when providing insanely great
            customer experiences across its global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanas&#8217; accent translation technology allows for deeper comprehension of people&#8217;s
            voices, increased foreign language fluency, and addresses communication challenges between global teams and
            customers. It enables CX service professionals to choose an accent that best removes friction in real time,
            while preserving the speaker&#8217;s authenticity, an experience that beta users and investors have
            described as &#8220;magical.&#8221; Customers want to clearly and easily understand the communication from
            contact centers and Sanas&#8217; technology will place Alorica at the forefront of that pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Linguistic translation allows us to focus on providing the best service experiences in real
            time regardless of native dialects that can result in confusion or bias,&#8221; said Greg Haller, Chief
            Executive Officer of Alorica. &#8220;Collaborating with Sanas will allow us to deploy this innovative
            technology throughout our entire infrastructure in a way that lets our CX team members do what they do best
            &#8211; provide industry-leading service without barriers.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The goal of Sanas has always been to bring people closer together and allow them to have
            choices when it comes to their communication styles &#8211; something that was previously only possible
            through extensive speech language pathology,&#8221; said Maxim Serebryakov, Chief Executive Officer of
            Sanas. &#8220;Similar to how consumers would experience service from a local service center, Sanas&#8217;
            technology brings that local comprehension to consumers from anywhere in the world,&#8221; added Sharath
            Keshava, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Sanas.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The strategic partnership positions Alorica and its clients with first-to-market, exclusive access
            to the technology and an advisory position with Sanas&#8217; leadership as part of a joint investment in the
            future of linguistic AI. Servicing over 250 clients across 16 countries in over 30 languages, Alorica
            specializes in integrating technologies that empower a global workforce to deliver differentiated service
            experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our mission is to provide personalized service and support experiences to clients&#8217; end
            customers across every industry and geography we serve,&#8221; said Andy Lee, Founder and Executive Chairman
            of Alorica. &#8220;As a leader in orchestrating technology and talent to provide strategic outcomes to
            clients, we continue to invest in solutions that remove friction and enhance the overall quality and
            execution of that experience.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Customer Service Business Process Outsourcing
            (BPO), Alorica&#8217;s strategic partnership with Sanas aligns with the company&#8217;s mission to open new
            global market opportunities and remove bias from the delivery of insanely great customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Customer Service Provider Recognized for Driving
            Positive Culture Change Based on Employee Feedback&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, California,
            July 14, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&#8212;&lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a
            trusted global
            leader in customer experience (CX) solutions, announced today that it won Comparably&#8217;s Best CEOs for
            Diversity Award. Based on the sentiment of employees of color who anonymously rated Alorica during a
            12-month period (July 2020 &#8211; June 2021),
            this award recognizes the Company for driving positive culture change and encouraging diversity and
            inclusion across the organization.
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#8220;With nearly 70% of our U.S. workforce comprised of minorities, I am incredibly
            proud of the impact we are making within our Alorica family and also in the communities in which we operate,&#8221;
            said Andy Lee, Chairman and CEO of Alorica.
            &#8220;Inclusiveness has always been a part of Alorica&#8217;s DNA. This award is a testament to the
            remarkable work our employees are leading through our TIDE program, which celebrates, supports and empowers
            diverse voices around the globe, and in
            turn, builds a stronger sense of unity. I share this recognition with every employee at Alorica who helps us
            build a work culture that is accepting, kind and encouraging.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020,
            Alorica launched &lt;a href="/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;TIDE&lt;/a&gt;, a
            grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiative as part of its global &lt;a
            href="/corporate-social-responsibility/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;program.
            Now an integral component of the employee experience, TIDE&#8217;s ongoing Real Talk series provides
            employees at all levels with an interactive forum to increase awareness, share experiences and develop
            solutions to social issues within their communities.
            Since its inception, Alorica&#8217;s TIDE teams have facilitated over 70&lt;em&gt; Real Talk sessions&lt;/em&gt;
            around the world. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This past year shined a vital spotlight on racial
            inequities," said Comparably CEO Jason Nazar. &#8220;Our annual Best CEOs for Diversity recognizes the
            leaders that employees of color have deemed as top-notch. This year's list is no exception with an
            incredible group of chief executives, like Alorica's Andy Lee, that have shown strong leadership through the
            pandemic and a commitment to DE+I in their organizations." &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica is the
            world&#8217;s largest minority-owned business process outsourcing (BPO) provider and certified as a Minority
            Business Enterprise (MBE) by both the National Minority Supplier Development Council and Southern California
            Minority Supplier
            Development Council. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparably&#8217;s Best CEOs for Diversity Award is among
            several accolades Alorica has received since last year, including the 2021 Stevie Award which recognized
            Alorica for &lt;a

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Minority-Owned Business of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. The company was also distinguished

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IRVINE, Calif., April 15, 2022&#8212;&lt;/b&gt; In partnership with non-profit

            next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently shared highlights from its
            year of grassroots giving and volunteerism in the newly-released &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/insights/resource/2021-making-lives-better-with-alorica-impact-report"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;2021 MLBA Impact Report&lt;/a&gt;. The annual report demonstrates Alorica&#8217;s
            ongoing commitment to further its &lt;a href="http://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt; (CSR) initiatives through employee-led
            programs around the world, such as MLBA. In 2021, MLBA raised nearly $800,000 and awarded 1,142 grants
            totaling over $580,000 to help Alorica individuals, their families, communities and other local non-profits
            in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High on the list of MLBA&#8217;s contributions last year was the launch of the
            organization&#8217;s first-ever Inspiration Fund, which provided financial assistance to middle and high
            school students who otherwise could not afford to pursue their interests. More than 40 grants totaling over
            $63,000 were awarded to students in 7 countries to fund activities, such as piano lessons, coding classes,
            laptops and more. To help raise money for the cause, Alorica&#8217;s Executive Leadership Team&#8212;including
            Chief Culture Officer and MLBA President Joyce Lee and CEO Greg Haller&#8212;raised nearly $40,000 through
            the company&#8217;s first global health &amp;amp; wellness competition. The fundraiser&#8212;Miles 4 MLBA&#8212;had
            senior executives virtually compete against each other through various exercises&#8212;biking, walking,
            running, yoga, etc. with employees pledging donations to the Inspiration Fund on behalf of the leaders&#8217;
            efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLBA also received GuideStar's coveted Platinum Seal of Transparency for the
            first time, the highest level of recognition awarded to organizations who demonstrate a strong commitment to
            fiscal responsibility and transparency for donors worldwide by providing clear fundraising goals and
            consistently reaching them. To add to the accolades, MLBA was named, alongside Joyce Lee, a Silver winner in
            the 18th annual Stevie&#174; Awards for Women in Business for &#8220;Most Valuable Non-Profit Response&#8221;.
            Lee was honored for leading MLBA&#8217;s pandemic relief efforts through a culture of connection and
            empowerment, providing grant donations, charity support and resource assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;2021
            was a memorable year for both MLBA and Alorica,&#8221; said Joyce Lee, Alorica&#8217;s Chief Culture Officer
            and MLBA President. &#8220;Our teams got creative, rallied together, tried new things and put their heart
            into doing good for our communities. I am deeply grateful for our Aloricans around the globe who genuinely
            care and selflessly give. It&#8217;s this collective mindset that makes us who we are at Alorica and allows
            non-profits like MLBA to make a difference when and where it truly counts.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica
            is the primary corporate sponsor of MLBA, providing administrative resources, logistics and personnel costs
            required to fuel the non-profit. In turn, MLBA is an integral part of Alorica&#8217;s larger commitment to
            CSR, which champions programs that align with the company&#8217;s vision of making lives better, one
            interaction at a time. Alorica&#8217;s approach to CSR is categorized under three pillars&#8212;Philanthropy

            Poland. The latest example of their ambitious geo-diversification plan, the company has invested in Poland
            as an integral part of its service expansion, based on its multilingual capabilities, highly skilled talent,
            and progressive digital investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a

            Egypt, in addition to its existing operations in Sofia, Bulgaria. This investment targets high-growth
            markets with scalable talent, leveraging &lt;a

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;innovative technologies&lt;/a&gt; to engage employees and customers through

            operations in over 30 languages, to leading companies across a range of in-demand industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt
            Sims, President of EMEA Operations at Alorica, emphasized the benefits that the new office brings to
            businesses seeking global expansion. "Our scalable and flexible solutions enable companies to globalize
            their business, especially with our strong and expansive language support. We provide customized delivery
            capabilities based on longstanding operational expertise and global best practices," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With
            the launch of its new site, Alorica plans to hire hundreds of locals in the area for both onsite and remote
            careers. Spanning over 4,700 square meters across two floors, the new office&#8212;which is strategically
            located in the REACT building near Galeria Lodzk&#8212;boosts capacity to accommodate 650 employees to start
            and offers attractive amenities, accessible transportation and surrounding retail stores to help promote
            economic development and promising career prospects for the local workforce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading the
            operations at our new &#321;&#243;d&#378; location is Poland&#8217;s Site Director Kamila Wozniakowska, a
            &#321;&#243;d&#378; native with an impressive 14-year tenure in the BPO industry. "Kamila's journey began in

            investment underscores Alorica's commitment to contributing to the region's progress in becoming a
            world-class business hub. Alorica Poland has already begun forging strategic partnerships locally to bolster
            talent acquisition in the country through collaborations with industry associations and leading educational
            institutions. These partnerships enable the company to recruit top-tier professionals, contribute to
            enriching the local economy and fostering community development. Last year alone, Alorica promoted over
            5,000 team members in which more than half were women, which led to the company earning an award for
            Achievement in Developing &amp;amp; Promoting Women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alorica is a well-recognized global
            CX provider that I&#8217;m excited to help lead here in my country as the company continues to grow across

            as part of the sixth annual Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards, one of the world&#8217;s leading business awards
            programs. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica achieved Gold designations in two categories:

            &lt;a href="/awards-recognition/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;global leader in digital customer experience

            rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;GuideStar's &lt;/a&gt;coveted
            Platinum Seal of Transparency, the highest level of recognition awarded to organizations that clearly
            present a five-year strategic plan and then consistently reach their outlined goals. GuideStar is the
            world's largest source of nonprofit data and
            highlights organizations that provide meaningful data and results to simplify the nonprofit evaluation
            process for potential donors. MLBA earned its first GuideStar Seal of Transparency in 2019 at the Gold level
            and this year has climbed up to reach
            the Platinum level. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am so proud of MLBA and thankful to all our
            volunteer Chapter board members for their hard work that earned us this designation,&#8221; said MLBA
            President and Alorica Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee. &#8220;Our Chapters work tirelessly to raise
            funds and make donations to support Alorica employees, their loved ones and their communities in crisis
            situations when they have nowhere else to turn. This Seal gives current and potential donors clarity and
            assurance about our purpose, process and
            progress to truly make lives better.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of empowered Alorica
            employees making connections all across the globe, thousands of individuals and families have been touched
            by MLBA. In just six years since its inception, MLBA Chapters&#8212;led by Alorica employees&#8212;have
            raised
            over $6.5 million, awarded more than 11,500 grants and developed hundreds of charitable partnerships to help
            those in need and support their communities. Through grassroots fundraising activities and payroll
            contributions, MLBA Chapters offer assistance
            to local causes of their choice. Grants have been awarded to provide for essential needs, such as housing
            and medical costs, utility bills and funeral expenses, as well as to aid those affected by natural
            disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency reconfirms that MLBA
            upholds the highest level of accountability and is worthy of its donors' confidence and generosity,&#8221;
            added Lee. &#8220;And that&#8217;s important to us. It&#8217;s something
            we will remain focused on as we continue to share the love.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; Last month, Lee and MLBA took

            is a nonprofit that takes the traditional approach to corporate philanthropy and turns it on its head.
            Instead of company headquarters
            at Alorica Inc.&#8212;a global customer experience provider&#8212;deciding where and how to make charitable
            contributions, Alorica employees are empowered to give to those in need at a local level within their own
            communities&#8212;allowing them to
            share the love with the people, and in the places, that matter most to them. With over 60 MLBA Chapters
            around the world, Alorica employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better
            through grants, fundraisers and volunteering&#8212;and
            100% of funds raised by a Chapter stays within that Chapter. Alorica provides the administrative resources
            required to fuel this global nonprofit as part of its &lt;a

        <description>&lt;h5&gt;Leading CX Provider Delivers Historic Volumes in Social CX Services During the Pandemic&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE,
            California (August 31, 2020)&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211;&lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,
            a leading global customer experience solutions provider, has announced the expansion of its digital support
            offerings to meet surging client demand. As the world adjusts to evolving COVID-19 guidelines&#8212;closures,
            stay-at-home orders and social distancing&#8212;Alorica&#8217;s suite of services is tailored to &lt;a
            href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;digital CX&lt;/a&gt; including social media customer care, content
            moderation, online reputation management and online fraud protection. To manage the influx of these programs
            along with the company&#8217;s overall growth this year,
            Alorica is making significant investments totaling approximately $50 million, which includes &lt;a
            href="/news/detail/alorica-rapidly-expands-with-global-hiring-effort-to-fill-more-than-33-000-positions"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;the hiring of 33,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; to keep consumers and brands connected
            in this digital economy. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through its pandemic-proof platform, Alorica helps clients promote and protect their
            brands&#8217; digital presence by managing and moderating their social media engagement, online communities
            and forums, business listings and customer reviews, advertisements,
            search engine rankings and more. Currently supporting over 30 countries in more than 15 languages, Alorica
            handles nearly a billion social CX transactions per year. This work is done on behalf of the largest
            companies in the world across key industries,
            such as digital entertainment and social media networks, ecommerce and online marketplaces, software and
            consumer electronics, online banking and on-demand delivery apps. Additionally, thousands of Alorica&#8217;s
            problem-solving global team members
            handle content moderation to safeguard brands and online communities from abusive content. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a feedback economy where brand reputation is defined by public opinion, Alorica
            helps companies engage, be discovered and recommended online,&#8221; said Chris Crowley, Alorica&#8217;s
            Chief Commercial Officer. &#8220;We help increase impressions,
            engagement and ultimately spend on behalf of our clients. For social media customer care alone, we manage
            more than 54 million interactions annually.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID-19 where online activities like shopping, live streaming and social
            networking have become more prevalent, associated risks have also increased with alarming speed. According
            to Sift&#8217;s Q2 2020 Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index, in the
            first half of 2020, online marketplaces were hit with a 109% increase in attempted identity theft with
            nearly half of it being financially motivated scams. Utilizing leading fraud prevention systems for the past
            10 years, Alorica delivers solutions
            for identity &amp;amp; credit monitoring as well as detection of account takeovers, fraud and data breaches&#8212;resolving
            over 2 million fraud cases annually for online customers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our job is not only to protect our clients&#8217; brand equity and their customers&#8217;
            trust, but also to keep the internet safe. As digital interactions continue to grow at a tremendous rate,
            this responsibility becomes even more important,
            explained Crowley. &#8220;Based on our ability to deliver on the overwhelming need so far this year, we have
            experienced 128% growth in managing these social CX programs, and we&#8217;re looking forward to seven-fold
            growth in this space by 2022.&#8221;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Doing Good Around the World by Hiring People in Disadvantaged Circumstances&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
            href="http://www.alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a&amp;nbsp;global&amp;nbsp;leader
            in customer experience solutions, today&amp;nbsp;announced it has been selected&amp;nbsp;to be included in
            IAOP&#8217;s Impact Sourcing Champions Index in partnership
            with the Global Mentorship Initiative (GMI). The Index is IAOP&#8217;s inaugural list of companies that have
            distinguished themselves as trailblazers in Impact Sourcing. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies implementing Impact Sourcing prioritize providing career development
            opportunities to people who otherwise have limited prospects. According to IAOP, it has been shown to
            provide many business benefits, including access to new sources of talent,
            higher levels of employee engagement, and lower attrition rates, while offering employees their first step
            onto a career ladder that leads to economic self-sufficiency. As Alorica continues to grow and hire
            thousands of locals in the countries it
            operates around the world, the company remains committed to creating career paths for those most in need.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debi Hamill, IAOP&#8217;s CEO, explained, &#8220;Doing well by doing good is now more
            important than ever. Ensuring that disadvantaged populations have access to formal employment and decent
            work, allowing them to improve their conditions, acquire a career,
            and thus lift themselves, their families, and their communities out of poverty is one of the most suitable
            means to economic growth. I am proud of the work these organizations are doing.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are honored to be a part of IAOP&#8217;s Impact Sourcing Champions Index,&#8221;
            said Joyce Lee, Chief Culture Officer at Alorica. Our vision of making lives better one interaction at a
            time doesn&#8217;t just apply to the customers we serve,
            but also to our Aloricans around the world, especially those who just need a little hand up to better
            support themselves, their families and their communities. As a large employer in many of the countries we
            operate, we will keep doing what we can
            to create a positive impact wherever we can through impact sourcing, which has never been more important. It&#8217;s
            the right thing to do and we look forward to continue partnering with organizations like IAOP to be a part
            of the solution.&#8221;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce Lee also serves as a Co-Chair of IAOP&#8217;s SRO Chapter. The Social
            Responsibility in Outsourcing Chapter (SRO) is chartered with promoting awareness for how the BPO industry
            can embrace social responsibility in their business strategy.&amp;nbsp;The
            Chapter was created to encourage companies to share their success and learnings from implementing various
            socially responsible models including; impact sourcing, establishing a social mission and tactics, ethical
            labor practices, sustainability, and

        <description>&lt;h5&gt;Investment to Improve Capital Structure and Strategic Flexibility&lt;/h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;Additional Liquidity to Address High Demand for Alorica&#8217;s CX Solutions with Market, Product
            and Talent Investments&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, CALIF / NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;
            &#8211; Alorica Inc., a global leader in customer experience solutions, today announced a refinancing led by
            funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE: APO) (together with
            its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;Apollo&#8221;), one of the world&#8217;s leading alternative
            investment managers. Through the transaction, Apollo funds have invested $750 million of preferred equity
            and debt to enable a comprehensive refinancing
            that optimizes Alorica&#8217;s financial position and growth trajectory by adding incremental liquidity,
            reducing overall debt and extending debt maturities. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment is structured to support the increasing demand for Alorica&#8217;s
            customer experience solutions, providing strategic flexibility for the company to accelerate its growth
            initiatives. Following the transaction, the company will have more
            than $200 million in liquidity and net leverage of under 3.0x LTM Adjusted EBITDA. Alorica plans to grow its
            world-class talent and continue its &lt;a href="/outcomes/continuity/geo-optimization/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;global expansion&lt;/a&gt; through
            Asia, Europe and Latin America. The company will also continue to invest in next-generation products
            including its work-at-home solution, &lt;a href="/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure high
            performance, security and compliance. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction was led by Apollo&#8217;s Hybrid Value platform, which provides flexible
            capital to both private and public companies seeking tailored solutions and strategic advice through
            non-control investments. Apollo Partner Robert Kalsow-Ramos will
            join Alorica&#8217;s board of directors. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica CEO Andy Lee said, &#8220;The investment by Apollo funds is another major
            milestone in the evolution of Alorica. The refinancing gives us one of the healthiest balance sheets in the
            industry, advances our reputation as the undeniable global leader
            in CX, digital services and content moderation, and positions us strongly for growth. This will enable us to
            accelerate what we set out to do since day one&#8212;invest in our best-in-class talent and technology to
            deliver our clients industry-leading
            solutions.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee added, &#8220;With a proven track record of supporting global growth for leading
            companies, Apollo will help us capitalize on the tremendous opportunities we see today, driven by digital
            transformation and new workforce management models.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe Alorica has the right combination of expertise, scale and
            transformational strategy for long-term market leadership,&#8221; said Robert Kalsow-Ramos, Apollo Private
            Equity Partner. &#8220;We look forward to supporting Alorica&#8217;s
            continued growth and investments in the business so they can deliver great experiences for their clients.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apollo Hybrid Value Co-heads and Senior Partners Matt Michelini and Rob Ruberton said,
            &#8220;We are pleased to invest in Alorica through a structure that is responsive to their financial and
            corporate goals. Alorica will continue to be a founder-led
            company while benefitting from our expertise and ability to deploy flexible, scaled solutions with speed.
            This transaction is indicative of the benefits we can bring to bear through the Hybrid Value platform.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, Alorica, a founder and minority-led organization, has led the
            customer experience market in providing operational excellence that delivers optimized services and
            efficiencies for its clients. With the refinancing complete, the
            company will focus on executing its transformational strategy designed to capture significant growth in 2021
            and beyond, while continuing to prioritize the customer experience and its commitment to Making Lives
            Better, One Interaction at a Time. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;em&gt;The resulting 1.2 billion-dollar Alorica is now one of the industry's largest brands,
            offering expanded capabilities, service offerings and delivery options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Irvine,
            Calif (January 9, 2015)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a title="Alorica" href="http://alorica.com/"
            target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica&lt;/a&gt;, a worldwide leading provider of customer
            management outsourcing solutions, today announced it has signed an agreement to acquire several of West
            Corporation&#8217;s (NASDAQ: WSTC) agent services businesses
            for a consideration of $275 million. In 2014, these businesses represented approximately $580 million in
            revenue. The acquisition broadens Alorica&#8217;s product offerings and market reach, enhances the company&#8217;s
            delivery capabilities and allows
            Alorica to continue its sustained, aggressive growth on a global scale. Now one of the largest US based
            Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) providers, the new, integrated Alorica projects $1.2 billion in revenue
            in 2015.
            &lt;br&gt;&#8220;West, is one of the pioneers and most successful players in the BPO industry,&#8221; said
            Andy Lee, CEO, Alorica. &#8220;Today&#8217;s acquisition strengthens Alorica&#8217;s market position, allows
            us to scale faster and expands our reach
            into new vertical markets. By combining the strengths of both companies, we will be able to deliver
            immediate value to our customers.&#8221; West&#8217;s agent services businesses provide large-scale customer
            contact solutions to a wide range of vertical
            markets. The strategic acquisition strengthens Alorica&#8217;s market position in three key areas:
            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global footprint:&lt;/strong&gt; Increases company&#8217;s geographical
            presence in the US, Latin America and the Philippines, while adding a market-leading work-at-home capability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets:
            &lt;/strong&gt;Enters Alorica into new markets, including healthcare, utilities and government, while
            strengthening Alorica&#8217;s position in communications, retail, travel, financial services and consumer
            products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services: &lt;/strong&gt;Expands current services offerings in
            customer care, technical support and sales, and adds receivables management and direct response capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The
            integration of West&#8217;s agent services businesses&#8217; workforce will add an additional 1,500
            nearshore employees (Jamaica and Mexico), 5,400 offshore employees (Philippines) and 18,400 domestic
            employees, bringing Alorica&#8217;s employee headcount
            to 48,000 employees. Over 5,000 of the 18,400 domestic employees work as part of the award-winning West at
            Home service. As a developer of one of the first work-at-home solutions, West utilizes state-of-the-art
            technology and a proprietary work force
            management system, Spectrum&#8482;, which will become a core component of Alorica&#8217;s work-at-home
            service offering.
            &lt;br&gt;&#8220;Alorica and West share a passion and track record for excellent performance and possess
            unparalleled industry knowledge,&#8221; continued Lee. &#8220;This acquisition is the next step in our
            strategic vision to grow Alorica to become the
            number one BPO provider in our addressable markets.&#8221;
            &lt;br&gt;&#8220;Alorica is committed to supporting West agent services customers and employees going
            forward,&#8221; said Tom Barker, chairman and CEO, West Corporation. &#8220;Our company cultures and
            technologies are complementary, and we will work closely
            together to ensure a smooth transition.&#8221;
            &lt;br&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of the West provided committed financing
            to complete the transaction. Wells Fargo Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to Alorica. McGuire
            Woods LLP acted as legal counsel to Alorica.

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;2020 CSR Highlights Affirm Global CX Provider&#8217;s Commitment to Philanthropy, People

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;, a global customer experience (CX)
            provider, today recapped key results from its 2020 &lt;a href="/corporate-social-responsibility/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;corporate social responsibility&lt;/a&gt; (CSR) initiatives including the
            formation of its newest global social impact program&#8212;TIDE (Together for Inclusion, Diversity and
            Equity). Concurrently, the company&#8217;s non-profit partner, &lt;a href="https://livesbetter.org/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt;

            $6.5 million in employee-led donations to-date, which marks a significant
            milestone only five years after its inception. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who we are as a company is defined by our people. And during an epically
            challenging year like 2020, where both our organization and the global community at large were impacted,
            Aloricans around the world showed up in a tremendous way to help those
            in need,&#8221; said Joyce Lee, Chief Culture Officer at Alorica and President of MLBA. &#8220;I&#8217;m
            humbled by the selflessness, dedication and resourcefulness our employees continue to demonstrate in
            supporting each other, while giving back
            to their communities. Last year taught us that together, as a family, we can overcome almost anything and
            truly make lives better where it counts the most.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

            through charitable giving, social impact and environmental sustainability.
            In line with this mission, several notable achievements were made in 2020, including: &amp;nbsp;

            rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;MLBA&lt;/a&gt; celebrated five years of service, a year
            which marked significant progress on its quest to make lives better around the world, especially
            for those in need. The non-profit raised nearly $867,000 in monetary donations and supported 68 charity
            partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throughout the course of the year, MLBA awarded 924 grants totaling over
            $527,000 in support of housing, medical and utility costs, charity programs, funeral expenses and
            necessities, such as groceries and related essentials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, through its Crisis
            Relief Fund, more than $73,000 was distributed and 400+ families were assisted during disasters, such as
            Hurricane Iota, Hurricane Eta, Volcano Taal and COVID-19 among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt;
            &#8211; &lt;em&gt;Our People Are Everything &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In September 2020,
            Alorica introduced TIDE, a grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion program that is now an integral part
            of the company&#8217;s global employee experience. Through a regular Real Talk series, employees at all
            levels have an interactive
            forum to create awareness, share experiences and develop creative solutions to social issues in our
            communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launched in 2018, the &lt;a

            platform for women in
            leadership roles to share their experience and advice. The 2020 speaker series featured Callie Field, EVP of
            Customer Care at T-Mobile, and Dr. Kristen Ray, VP of Wellness at Bayless Healthcare, among other
            influential executives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alorica was also distinguished as an &lt;a

            href="https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;global leader in digital customer
            experience (CX) solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
            has recently been recognized on Comparably&#8217;s top 100 large companies for 2021 for both &lt;em&gt;Best
            Companies for Diversity and Best Companies for Women&lt;/em&gt;. These notable lists were determined by
            using : https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/core
            culture metrics &#8211; compensation, career growth, leadership, work environment &#8211; and were derived
            from 15 million ratings from anonymous employees across 70,000 companies. The two recognitions underscore
            Alorica&#8217;s DEI efforts through
            its global programs TIDE (Together for Inclusivity, Diversity &amp;amp; Equity) and Women&#8217;s
            Initiative. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are proud of our diverse representation and inclusive environment with more than 60% of
            our global workforce comprised of women and nearly 70% of our U.S. workforce made up of minorities,&#8221;
            said Joyce Lee, Chief Culture Officer at Alorica.
            &#8220;This is driven by our culture of celebrating and empowering diverse voices, which is at the core of
            our success. We remain committed to creating a safe and nurturing workplace for Aloricans all around the
            world to connect, support and learn
            from one another.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Through its &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate
            Social Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; program, Alorica is committed to three pillars&#8212;philanthropy,
            people and the planet. In keeping
            with its grassroots approach, Alorica&#8217;s DEI program &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIDE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            provides an interactive forum for Aloricans to discuss and share perspectives
            about the social issues most important to them including DEI, gender bias, sexual orientation,
            discrimination and stereotypes. TIDE teams around the world have led more than 90 &lt;em&gt;Real Talk&lt;/em&gt;
            sessions, covering key topics, such as Black Lives
            Matter and the LGBTQIA+ community. Additionally, the Women&#8217;s Initiative Speaker Series has become one
            of Alorica&#8217;s most recognized programs with influential female leaders from within and outside the
            company participating as guest speakers
            to educate and engage employees at all levels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to see Alorica recognized on two of our leading lists for Best Companies
            for Diversity and Best Companies for Women,&#8221; said Comparably CEO Jason Nazar. &#8220;Alorica&#8217;s
            ranking is a testament to the organization&#8217;s
            dedication to building a diverse, inclusive and equitable work environment.&#8221; Rankings were determined
            based on a series of questions in 16 core culture metrics, from compensation (salary, bonus, raises) and
            career growth (opportunities, mentorship,
            goals) to leadership (CEO, executives, direct managers) and work environment (work-life balance, perks &amp;amp;
            benefits, coworkers) &#8211; which provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of what it&#8217;s
            really like for minorities or women
            in the workplace. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This distinction follows a number of other DEI-focused accolades Alorica has received, including
            the &lt;a href="/news/detail/alorica-wins-silver-in-11th-annual-best-in-biz-awards"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Global CX leader wins Gold Stevie&#174; Award for insanely great employee experience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRVINE,
            Calif &#8211; August 30, 2021 &#8211; &lt;a href="/home"&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a
            href="/awards-recognition"&gt;global leader in customer experience (CX) solutions&lt;/a&gt;, has been named
            the winner of the Gold
            Stevie&#174; Award for Employer of the Year in the Business &amp;amp; Professional Services category in the
            sixth annual Stevie Awards for Great Employers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This recognition reflects Alorica&#8217;s deep-seated belief that our employees
            are at the heart of the company&#8217;s success,&#8221; said Andy Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Alorica.
            &#8220;As we continue to hire thousands of people globally,
            it&#8217;s imperative that we maintain this unrivaled employee experience by creating the best environment
            for ongoing learning and career development. We don&#8217;t take for granted the 100,000 Aloricans who
            choose Alorica as their employer every
            day, and we welcome passionate problem solvers looking to elevate their careers to join the family.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stevie Awards for Great Employers recognize the world&#8217;s best employers and the
            human resources professionals, teams, achievements and HR-related products and suppliers who help to create
            and drive great places to work. With more than 950 nominations
            from organizations of all sizes in 29 nations, Alorica was honored to be chosen as the greatest business and
            professional services employer. More than 70 professionals worldwide participated in the judging process to
            select this year&#8217;s Stevie
            Award winners. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through its &lt;a href="/awards-recognition"&gt;award-winning training programs&lt;/a&gt;,
            culture initiatives and constant feedback loop measured by its employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), Alorica
            focuses heavily on employee engagement and
            performance. The organization is proudly comprised of many cultures, languages and backgrounds and views
            diversity as a core strength; more than 61% of its global workforce is women and nearly 70% of its US team
            is made up of minorities. And through
            its &lt;a href="/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere"&gt;work-at-home solution&#8212;Alorica Anywhere&#8212;&lt;/a&gt;employees
            are offered additional flexibility and support, which includes gamified digital tools to help them improve
            their confidence, skills as well as KPIs. This Employer of the Year award demonstrates the company&#8217;s
            commitment to its employees, which has resulted in increased employee satisfaction, lower attrition rates,
            and more leaders being promoted from
            within the organization year over year. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica also embraces a family-like culture of inclusiveness and giving through its &lt;a
            href="/corporate-social-responsibility"&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the
            company&#8217;s employee-led partnership with
            non-profit Making Lives Better with Alorica (&lt;a href="https://livesbetter.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="follow noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;MLBA&lt;/a&gt;), which has raised more than $6.5
            million since 2015. In 2020, Alorica launched &lt;a href="/diversity-equity-and-inclusion"&gt;TIDE&lt;/a&gt;
            (Together for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity), its global social impact program that serves as a
            cornerstone for the entire employee experience. TIDE&#8217;s Real Talk sessions provide an interactive forum
            for Aloricans
            to come together and discuss social issues that are most important to them and their communities&#8212;topics
            include gender bias, sexual orientation, discrimination and dismantling stereotypes. &amp;nbsp;

            Customer Service for MLB. &#8220;During a tumultuous time, sports have continued to serve as a welcome
            reprieve from the stresses associated with the
            pandemic. We couldn&#8217;t do what we do so successfully without the remarkable work of partners like
            Alorica that share our commitment to providing the best customer experience for our patrons. We&#8217;re
            excited for this new season.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the disruption of COVID-19 on the baseball season last year, Alorica seamlessly
            supported MLB&#8217;s consumer-centric culture and provided incredible experiences for MLB viewers. In the
            peak of Spring Training 2020, Alorica deployed hundreds
            of agents across several contact centers but quickly adapted when the season became delayed. As the season
            resumed, Alorica once again had hundreds of agents ready to handle Opening Day customer contact volumes. As
            a result, Alorica helped MLB achieve
            all-time record customer support levels on Opening Day last season&#8212;improving average handle time by
            50% compared to past years, and empowering employees to become a voice for the MLB customer through
            strategic coaching and training opportunities.
            &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a
            href="https://www.mckinsey.com/pe/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/Boosting%20contact%20center%20performance%20through%20employee%20engagement/Boosting-contact-center-performance-through-employee-engagement.ashx"
            target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;,
            customer service agents who are highly engaged and highly satisfied are three times more likely to feel
            extremely empowered to resolve customer
            issues. To ensure top-notch delivery to clients like MLB, Alorica keeps all associates, including their &lt;a
            href="/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica Anywhere work at home &lt;/a&gt;employees,
            engaged
            in the process of improving the organization&#8217;s service. For example, Alorica receives customer
            satisfaction data for 100% of interactions through Zacoustic&#8217;s calibration system. This unique
            strategy allows agents to help identify and address
            improvement opportunities derived from customer satisfaction insights. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At Alorica, we pride ourselves in our &lt;a href="/awards-recognition/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;industry-leading operations&lt;/a&gt; and solutions to deliver the &lt;a
            href="/culture/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;best customer experiences&lt;/a&gt;,
            and we congratulate MLB on this important recognition,&#8221; added Shawn Stacy, Chief Client Officer for
            Alorica. &#8220;Despite the inherent challenges associated with the 2020 season, both Alorica and MLB were
            committed to keeping the customer&#8217;s
            experience at the center of our planning and execution. The success of our shared efforts demonstrates
            Alorica&#8217;s commitment to bring together the right combination of technology and data to drive
            performance analytics, leading to award-winning
            results in a rapidly changing environment.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Alorica Announces First-Ever Impact Sourcing Partnership with IAOP to Support Venezuelan
            Refugees in Colombia&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif. &#8211; (Feb. 22, 2021)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&#8211;
            &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a
            global leader in customer experience solutions, has been named on the well-known International Association
            of Outsourcing Professionals&#8217; (IAOP) &lt;a href="https://www.iaop.org/Content/19/165/5037"
            rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Global Outsourcing 100&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(GO100)
            list for its seventh year in a row. This recognition features
            the world&#8217;s best outsourcing service providers and advisors from across all industries, areas of
            specialization and company size.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Global Outsourcing 100 and
            its sub-list are essential references for companies seeking new and expanded relationships with the industry&#8217;s
            best companies. Judging is based on a rigorous scoring methodology that includes an independent review
            by a panel of IAOP customer members with extensive experience in selecting outsourcing services providers
            and advisors for their organizations. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being recognized in The Global Outsourcing 100 every year is a testament to our
            industry-leading ability to deliver insanely great customer interactions,&#8221; said Greg Haller, Chief
            Operating Officer at Alorica. &#8220;This year, we take even
            greater pride as we further our commitment to &lt;a
            href="/news/detail/alorica-named-an-impact-sourcing-champion-on-iaops-first-ever-distinguished-list/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;impact sourcing&lt;/a&gt; while we prepare to launch operations in Colombia&#8212;our
            most recent example of expanding operations to support our clients.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the recent OWS21 annual conference, IAOP, non-profit business network Tent
            Partnership for Refugees, Colombia&#8217;s BPO association BPrO and several major BPO companies&#8212;including
            Alorica&#8212;announced their first impact sourcing initiative
            to integrate Venezuelan refugees into the Colombian workforce. With five million Venezuelans having fled
            their country due to the instability and turmoil in recent years, Colombia alone has welcomed approximately
            two million of these refugees. Alorica
            has pledged its commitment to include Venezuelan refugees as part of the plan to hire hundreds in Colombia
            in conjunction with its market launch later this year. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, more than ever, outsourcing end-users need to be able to easily identify and select
            the right company for their outsourcing needs," said Debi Hamill, IAOP CEO. "It is great recognition being
            named to The Global Outsourcing 100. Given the strong,
            global competition, Alorica should be proud of achieving excellence in the field." &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaron Schwartz, Head of Impact Sourcing at the Tent Partnership for Refugees said, "We're
            thrilled to welcome Alorica to the Tent family, and we're so proud of their intention to hire Venezuelans in
            Colombia once they launch their operations there this
            year. This will build on their existing efforts to hire Venezuelans in other countries such as Mexico,
            Panama and Uruguay." &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For companies looking for guidance and support with their outsourcing strategy, Alorica&#8217;s
            regular inclusion on the GO100 list and many &lt;a href="/awards-recognition/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recent
            accolades&lt;/a&gt; reflect our high-quality, scalable

            Optimization Model Provides Additional Flexibility and Enhanced Support for Remote Employees While Removing
            Geographic Constraints for Hiring Top Talent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;IRVINE, Calif., April 26, 2022&lt;/strong&gt; &#8212; &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alorica Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/awards-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global
            leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions,&lt;/a&gt; today introduced its global
            Connection Hubs, a network of operational sites designed to complement the company&#8217;s expanding Alorica
            Anywhere work-at-home solution, while scaling talent acquisition and support in target markets. These
            facilities offer work-at-home employees a centralized location to further connect with their teams in person
            for recruiting, training, IT support, culture and engagement activities and more. Having already launched in
            four countries since late last year, the company is set to open its next Alorica Connection Hub this week in
            Candon City, Ilocos Sur&#8212;the first in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"As we define the future of work, a primary consideration for our &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/continuity/workforce-optimization"&gt;workforce optimization&lt;/a&gt;
            strategy is the evolving employee experience," said Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer at Alorica. &#8220;With
            the global economy adjusting to a new normal, our focus continues to be the welfare of our employees. We
            want to do what&#8217;s best for them by combining the best of remote and in-person engagement. That
            includes establishing offices where there are high-quality candidate pools including multilingual
            capabilities, and physically being there for our remote team members when they need additional support. The
            Alorica Connection Hubs allow us to enhance our interactions with employees, which leads to enhanced
            performance and exceptional delivery of customer service.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Candon Connection Hub in the Philippines is equipped with training, recruiting and meeting
            rooms as well as docking workstations, giving associates access to information technology support and other
            services. Work-at-home employees in the area will provide CX support in technology, customer care and
            digital services on behalf of leading brands, adding to growing workforce across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Philippines&#8217; new site joins existing Connection Hubs in the United States, Latin America
            and Europe including successful launches in La Ceiba, Honduras; Quer&#233;taro, Mexico and Warsaw, Poland.
            This summer, Alorica plans to open its next Connection Hub in Veracruz, Mexico. With workforce optimization
            in mind, the Connection Hubs were established to seamlessly integrate with the company&#8217;s secure,
            cloud-based, work-at-home&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere"&gt;Alorica

            journey has increased employee satisfaction and performance as well as led to multiple industry recognitions
            including &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/insights/resource/alorica-has-been-named-a-leader-in-the-2022-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-customer-service-bpo"&gt;Leader
            in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Customer Service BPO&lt;/a&gt;. One of the platforms within Alorica
            Anywhere that has helped lead to increased employee satisfaction and performance is Alorica Connect, a
            digital gamified website and mobile app that engages new employees from onboarding to production and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alorica has been a pioneer in hybrid work models for over two decades,&#8221; added Haller.

            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El director ejecutivo de Invest Pacific, Alejandro Ossa, destac&#243; la
            llegada de Alorica. &#8220;Despu&#233;s de un ejercicio de evaluaci&#243;n intenso por varias ciudades de
            Colombia, Alorica opt&#243; por establecerse en Cali, en donde en un principio demandar&#225; un n&#250;mero
            importante de empleos, pero en cuesti&#243;n de unos 24 meses habr&#225; escalado en la generaci&#243;n de
            empleo en la ciudad y el pa&#237;s.
            &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Por su parte, Carolina Cobos, quien fue nombrada gerente del call center de
            Alorica, dijo: &#8220;Estoy emocionada de unirme a la familia Alorica y ayudar a promover su misi&#243;n de
            mejorar la vida, no solo para nuestros clientes, sino tambi&#233;n para los miles de colaboradores a los que
            ayudaremos a alcanzar sus objetivos personales y profesionales&#8221;.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica emplear&#225; a personas que sean bachilleres y totalmente biling&#252;es (que
            tengan un nivel de ingl&#233;s superior a B2). No se necesita tener una carrera profesional.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

            &lt;br&gt;
            La empresa estadounidense dejar&#225; una derrama de 60 millones de pesos anuales y 600 empleos en Veracruz
            y Boca del R&#237;o.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;La empresa estadounidense '&lt;strong&gt;Alorica&lt;/strong&gt;' inaugur&#243; en el municipio de&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Boca
            del R&#237;o&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;un centro de conexi&#243;n que proyectar&#225; cerca de 600 nuevos
            empleos en Veracruz.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Hoy inauguramos la primera oficina en la ciudad que servir&#225; de soporte para quienes trabajan
            desde casa y para que tengan un lugar al que puedan asistir en caso de que lo necesiten ya sea por problemas
            t&#233;cnicos o de entrenamientos constantes", Jos&#233; Ram&#237;rez, presidente de&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;en
            Latinoam&#233;rica y el Caribe.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jos&#233; Ram&#237;rez dio a conocer que fue el a&#241;o pasado cuando iniciaron con las
            contrataciones, teniendo actualmente a 300 personas trabajando desde casa.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detall&#243; que&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;se encarga de proveer&amp;nbsp;
            servicios t&#233;cnicos, cobros, ventas, telemarketing, etc., principalmente para empresas de Estados
            Unidos, por lo que el idioma ingl&#233;s es el principal requisito.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;La llegada de&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica&lt;/strong&gt;, dijo, significa un impacto econ&#243;mico
            importante ya que la compa&#241;&#237;a genera plazas de&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;empleo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;que
            exportan servicios de M&#233;xico, lo que representa dinero que entra al pa&#237;s en salarios, impuestos,
            servicios b&#225;sicos, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Durante la pandemia duplicamos nuestra fuerza laboral en M&#233;xico y la regi&#243;n de Veracruz
            y en los pr&#243;ximos dos a&#241;os vemos crecimiento y expansi&#243;n.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Adem&#225;s a la gente le gusta, ahorran transporte, comida, en ropa de oficina por ende es
            conveniente para la empresa y para sus empleados."&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Por su parte, Ted DeGennaro, vicepresidente de operaciones&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;M&#233;xico
            destac&#243; que el biling&#252;ismo existe en Veracruz, hecho que les da una visi&#243;n de crecimiento r&#225;pido
            en la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Esta ciudad tiene a muchas personas que hablan ingl&#233;s y no hay mucha oportunidad para ellos,
            por eso es que Veracruz y&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Boca del R&#237;o&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;estaban en n&#250;mero
            uno de nuestras listas para expandirnos en M&#233;xico", dijo el vicepresidente.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adem&#225;s destac&#243; un ingreso de 60 millones de pesos al a&#241;o a Veracruz, inversi&#243;n
            que calific&#243; como importante para la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finalmente se di&#243; a conocer que durante los pr&#243;ximos 24 y 25 de junio celebrar&#225;n una
            feria del&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;empleo&lt;/strong&gt;, por lo que invitaron a los interesados a acercarse y
            formar parte del equipo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A worldwide telecom provider was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and
            improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business. We implemented an
            innovative learning analytics solution, designed to root out agent
            training problems at the source. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After running a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of
            transformative. Download our Cracking the Code: A Learning Analytics Case Study to learn more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speed-to-proficiency&#8212;the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully
            serve their customers&#8212;is a driving Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for companies looking to streamline
            operations. One such company&#8212;a worldwide
            telecom provider&#8212;was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency
            in one of their most complex billing lines of business.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;To implement an innovative learning analytics solution&#8212;designed to root out agent training
            problems at the source&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Run a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Eradication of agent struggles&#8212;impacting new-hire trainee proficiency&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;5% reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 days&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;6-day reduction of new-hire training time&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;80% knowledge retention after 1 year&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            An Empowered Agent Starts with Better Training. Traditionally, the client&#8217;s agent training program was
            lengthy and costly&#8212;not to mention that agents weren&#8217;t consistently retaining all of the needed
            information to resolve customer billing inquiries. Enter Alorica. Our Training and Quality teams took a look
            at the situation and asked&#8212;how can we shorten the training process, while still helping agents retain
            knowledge? Faster and better&#8212;it&#8217;s
            not an easy code to crack! But then again, they don&#8217;t call us for the easy ones.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            A New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent
            knowledge retention and decreasing &#8216;confidently-held misinformation&#8217; by using an
            industry-leading learning analytics technology
            platform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period, confidently-held
            misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn, this resulted in
            enhanced knowledge retention, and thus the
            ability to better navigate customer billing queries.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In short, we were able to identify a problem the client didn&#8217;t even know they had&#8212;and
            then offer a solution that would totally change the game.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            We&#8217;re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful, the client is looking into adopting
            it for other areas of their business. Furthermore, we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents,
            who appreciated a novel, innovative
            and interesting approach to their training.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overall, the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency, observed a decrease in risk and loss, and
            realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction&#8212;all of which led to happier agents, happier
            customers and a happier client.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;div&gt;Customers expect brands to engage with them&#8212;and when they don&#8217;t get what
            they want, they go elsewhere. And that harms your business, your reputation, and your bottom line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;But with intelligent automation, you can give customers the service they expect while addressing
            the underlying causes of weak support&#8212;inconsistent agent delivery, expanding operational costs,
            process inefficiencies&#8212;seamlessly.&lt;span style="background-color: initial; font-size: inherit;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that consumers&#8217; expectations for a better customer
            experience are rising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/insights/resource/thats-what-she-said/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows that 80%
            of people will stop doing business with a company because of a negative service experience&#8212;with 67% of
            consumers leaving for a competitor after only one failed interaction. To differentiate from competitors and
            provide exceptional customer service,
            businesses need to transform the customer experience&#8212;but doing so requires data-driven insight into
            which processes are working and which are not.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer experience
            analytics can provide these types of insights and drive positive transformation. The challenge, however, is
            not just in collecting the right type of data but knowing how to pull insight from it. What data points are
            important? Which
            are not? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Type of Data You Need and Where to Find It&lt;/strong&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact centers, where agents interact directly with customers, provide a gold mine of
            customer intelligence. Each interaction is an opportunity to learn more about consumers in order to improve
            the customer experience. Typically, there are three types
            of data you should collect: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume Data &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Contact events are signs that
            something isn&#8217;t easy for customers to solve on their own. Knowing why customers contact you, by what
            channels, and with what frequency is key to understanding what the customer
            wants and where the stumbling blocks are. Look at average handle times, rates of repeat contacts,
            escalations and transfers to determine where there are breakdowns in the contact experience &#8211; these
            are the elements that may be negatively
            impacting your customers and your business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral and
            Emotional Data &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; This type of data measures how your agents handle each customer and
            how customers respond to the interaction. The data collected should include attributes such as communication
            and interaction
            skills, compliance, and product and procedural knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome
            Data &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; It&#8217;s important to be able to predict and replicate success. Outcome data
            tells you how frequently you are successful in meeting your business objectives once the interaction is
            over. For example, completing
            a sale, avoiding a cancel or gaining a high customer satisfaction rating are all positive outcomes you want
            to replicate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&amp;nbsp;

            &lt;p&gt;It is also critical that your data captures interactions that occur across all channels, so you can
            connect the pieces of the journey and understand which events trigger or prevent others.&lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Insights within the
            Data&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have collected a substantial amount of customer experience data, let&#8217;s
            discuss how to use analytics to find insights and improve the customer experience. Check out the below
            categories to consider when you&#8217;re looking to shake
            up the status quo. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anomalies &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Look at places where the result
            deviates from the norm. These statistical anomalies can identify areas of potential breakage in the customer
            experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confluence &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Identify where
            trends, such as economic and social (e.g., consumer spending habits and mobility trends), intersect with
            each other. The confluence of these trends can reveal new insights or opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frustrations
            &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Processes that result in poor outcomes, higher escalation rates or frequent
            complaints from frontline employees can pinpoint areas where resolution may be cumbersome or ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthodoxies
            &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Question any beliefs or assumptions that are not supported by correlative data.
            &#8220;How it has always been done&#8221; is not always the most effective way, nor is it the most
            forward-thinking approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extremities &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt;
            Look at your outliers. Observing contacts with strongly positive outcome data compared with those in similar
            situations with strongly negative outcome data can help you determine what differentiates a poor outcome
            from a positive one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voyages &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Allow the
            data to build a history or timeline that you can replicate and immerse yourself in. From here, you&#8217;ll
            be able to glean contextual insights that help you understand which sequences of events culminate
            in positive or negative outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analogies &#8211;&lt;/strong&gt;
            What you borrow or learn from the patterns and benchmarks of your competitors and other companies can
            enlighten your own business processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries you make from your
            customer experience analytics can inform how you coach and develop your employees, how you program your
            interactive voice response, what tools you use and how you evaluate and reward your employees and customers.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying Insights to Drive CX Transformation&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively apply the insights gleaned from the data to create transformation, you
            must make it digestible and actionable for those who have the ability to make change or alter course based
            on the findings. This effort requires collaboration and coordination
            across departments. It should make the translation from &#8220;What does it say?&#8221; to &#8220;What does
            it mean?&#8221;, so the cross-functional team can determine what to do about it. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When presented in these terms, the insights allow customer experience executives to not
            only clearly define what is going wrong (or right), but also to quantify the costs of problems&#8212;and any
            required solutions. In this way, business decisions become
            easier to make and to justify, and thereby speed up the transformation process and allow your business to
            remain competitive. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don't diss disruptive tech - because it's here to stay, and it's awesome! &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep
            making lives better&#8230;one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica, we&#8217;re
            all about using disruptive using technologies
            in our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we&#8217;re using
            to change the game&#8212;and the results we&#8217;ve seen so far. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICROLEARNING
            &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;80% of our new hires are millennials&#8212;and given their average
            90-second attention span, we&#8217;ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually
            engaging. We call this new approach microlearning&#8212;short, interactive, 2-10
            minute videos that deliver information &#8220;just in time&#8221;&#8212;right before the lessons are
            applied. Typically more effective than traditional &#8220;just in case&#8221; classroom learning,
            Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and
            help reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In action:&lt;/strong&gt; Microlearning reduced training time by as much as
            80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than
            traditional comparative training classes)&#8212;leading to significant
            cost savings for the client. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAMIFICATION &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events
            that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning&#8212; that&#8217;s gamification. Through it, employees can
            interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance,
            see how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We customize our systems to each client&#8217;s individual objective, and drive agent
            effort from &#8220;acceptable&#8221; to &#8220;optimal&#8221; performanc with game played and reward earned.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In action:&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to
            see positive results with agent performance, attrition, absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It&#8217;s
            simple&#8212;engaged employees, who receive a boost in recognition and
            incentives, perform better. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)&lt;/strong&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity, but they&#8217;re actually
            pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster, reduce performance variability and make the
            interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant.
            &amp;nbsp; There are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop
            screens into one singular view, allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA
            is all about workflow computerization, and
            these robots identify manual, repetitive and rules-based processes&#8212;tackling them in a fraction of the
            time that it would take an agent, and with complete accuracy. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In action:&lt;/strong&gt; For a major energy company, robotic automation
            reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10%, and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major
            telecommunications firm, robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing
            hundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&#8217;T
            DISS DISRUPTIVE TECH BECAUSE IT&#8217;S HERE TO STAY &#8212;AND IT&#8217;S AWESOME!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHATBOTS&lt;/strong&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels, and we&#8217;re
            implementing chatbot technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to
            their automated nature, chatbots can handle simultaneous
            candidate inquiries, provide real-time responses and conduct initial applicant screenings. And because they
            operate 24/7, we&#8217;ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and
            ultimately hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-action:&lt;/strong&gt; In three months&#8217; time, we
            were able to interview approximately 3,000 candidates, compared to 966 during the same time-frame without
            chatbots&#8212;saving over 1,200 recruiting man-hours and reducing the cost-per-hire
            by 84%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEECH ANALYTICS&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new tool is leading to all kinds of &#8216;a-ha!&#8217; moments. Through Speech
            Analytics, we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information.
            Are customers calling about billing? Technology? Something
            else? How did the call go? Was it a good customer experience? What could we be doing better? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-action:&lt;/strong&gt; Speech Analytics radically enhances our Quality
            Assurance model through technology. It allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better
            capabilities, identify call trends and themes, and help us create even
            more insanely great customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

        <html:link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://alorica.com/insights/resource/lessons-in-loyalty"/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While conducting research for this blog, it was surprising to find that the majority of
            what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to
            drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective
            that loyalty programs are, at their core, focused on driving revenue, but the lack of attention to how these
            programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer
            experience.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to keep sight of the
            potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the
            customer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving
            customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point
            when considering the customer experience
            is the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs, this takes the form
            of earning and utilizing the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and
            easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer
            experience: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Keep it simple and clear&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer effort is an important part of building
            loyalty,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a
            rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do
            this, keep these points in mind: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple points system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that
            translate into some type of reward, and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their
            reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship
            between points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of
            points, the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However, this system typically works best for businesses that
            encourage frequent short-term purchases.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a clear goal, and make it easy to see progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program, customers must look forward to a clear-cut
            goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they&#8217;ll lose interest.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of
            their rewards point balance, and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal.
            Providing customers with clear and easily accessible
            methods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A recent JD &amp;amp; Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President&#8217;s Club
            were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards
            programs.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Looking at their mobile apps
            and how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags
            behind.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/default-source/insights/phone_screenshot-768x663.png?sfvrsn=311081a1_0"
            height="663" class="size-medium_large wp-image-8015 aligncenter" width="768"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Monitor and control&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not
            using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates
            retention but can also help ascertain whether your
            customers feel that the program is too obtuse.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to
            measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20%, and the
            average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;If
            a redemption rate falls below 14%, it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for
            improvement. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and
            controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program
            members, gather info continuously to ensure that
            the organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and
            also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Use data for continuous improvement&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits, such as average transaction
            amount, most frequently purchased items, and much more.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;This data, combined
            with customer contact history, provides organizations with the
            ammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases. If a customer purchased a product and
            experienced an issue, chances are that they may experience a similar issue with a similar product. Smart
            businesses will use this data in
            concert to push proactive content to customers to reduce the likelihood of a future contact. &amp;nbsp;
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, right? Create a program that is easy to understand and use, measure its
            effectiveness, and use the data available to continuously improve your customers&#8217; experience. Seem
            daunting? If so, we&#8217;re here to help! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more
            accessible to a wider audience, with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard leading the charge.
            &lt;a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT set a new record for the fastest-growing consumer
            application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch.&lt;/a&gt;
            As a global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions, Alorica is already harnessing the power of
            generative AI to create more personalized brand interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s competitive
            business environment, every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers&#8217; needs. To
            deliver a positive customer experience, it's essential to understand intent, context, and sentiment to
            provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly. As a Large Learning Model
            (LLM), generative AI is often used to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the unique
            ability to be trained on large datasets. By seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with
            comprehension of massive content repositories, the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant
            responses that underpin chatbots, virtual assistants and other AI-driven language applications in a powerful
            way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an LLM, generative AI is a game-changing resource for contact centers delivering
            CX. Its conversation-generating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power self-service
            bots, automate email responders, and produce report summarizations. While automated chat responses already
            help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks, generative AI adds value in other areas,
            including in-depth analysis of customer interactions. Service organizations can use it to streamline
            customer service interactions quickly, easily, and accurately, saving significant time and resources. It
            also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, using this
            information to adapt their products, services, and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the overlooked
            benefits of generative AI is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data, such as
            conversations, chat interactions, and even operating manuals, which is a significant leap forward. This
            means that previously "dark data" can now be resurrected in a meaningful way, providing organizations with
            valuable intel that they were unable to access before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alorica has taken the
            lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative AI to enhance customer satisfaction and
            lifetime value.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For example, Alorica is collaborating with Microsoft
            and OpenAI on several proof of concepts. Through this partnership, Alorica is using ChatGPT to analyze
            millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client. The purpose of this initiative
            is to identify patterns and trends that will enable Alorica and its client to derive actionable insights
            with exponentially more speed, agility, scalability, consistency, and efficiency.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;By
            combining ChatGPT&#8217;s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with Alorica&#8217;s digital-first
            approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually, the goal is to establish use cases and
            applications that will transform CX. Its first task is to analyze 50,000 data assets from five years and
            produce a cohesive report in record time. ChatGPT is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing
            all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly. This project
            will uncover every &#8220;voice of the customer&#8221; more rapidly, precisely, and comprehensively.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative
            AI is not just a flashy new toy. It represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that
            promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve. The dawn of a new era in CX
            technology and engagement is upon us, and as an industry, we&#8217;ve only just scratched the surface. For
            this reason (and more), Alorica is eager to be at the forefront, harnessing the power of generative AI in
            its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

                   href="https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-to-automate-your-contact-center-without-leaving-your-employees-behind"/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend
            that is gaining momentum and a strategy that&#8217;s important to explore. But, it&#8217;s also important to
            remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low
            unemployment and high competition for talent, retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don&#8217;t
            let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage.

            &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying
            self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;you
            will be automating. That&#8217;s done by tuning into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;why&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;how&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;of
            the automation journey.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Make employees part of the why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employee
            engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in
            translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reason&#8217;s employees leave a company is because they don&#8217;t
            feel valued or challenged.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;A strong foundation is built when employees not
            only feel valued for their skills, but also for their ability to communicate well, focus on the real issues
            requiring complex problem solving, and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way.
            Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge
            facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a
            move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead, it&#8217;s meant to create more opportunities for
            them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Answer &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees
            want to know what&#8217;s in it for them, especially as fears arise about what automation means for future
            job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a
            great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily
            and what prevents true resolution.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ask what could be automated to improve
            the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues. Often times, the largest systemic
            flaws are identified in these meetings. You&#8217;ll walk away with a gold mine of information and employees
            will feel valued, trusted and, most importantly, heard.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact check the feedback against repeat calls, resolution rates, NPS&lt;sup style="top:
            -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"&gt;&#174;&lt;/sup&gt; scores and CSAT
            scores to demonstrate the ROI for the investments needed to correct the issue. Then go forth to develop your
            action plan. Don&#8217;t forget to close the loop &#8211; use your regular meetings to share your action
            plan and progress, ensuring it is understandable to those it will impact the most.

            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create a passion for self-service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep
            employees excited about a self-service culture by cultivating a campaign and infrastructure with them in
            mind. A few easy checks will ensure you&#8217;re doing just that.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you including hands-on classroom training on new applications, with skills
            verification and proficiency checks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your strategy for ongoing training when
            your website, app or other self-service tools are updated? Have you invested in a mobile learning lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are
            your contact center goals aligned with the move to self-service?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;How are you
            rewarding and recognizing employees for use and promotion of self-service channels?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
            employees understand&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;a
            process like automation makes both their lives and the customers&#8217; lives easier, they will be more
            likely to not only to adopt, but to promote it. Following these key guidelines to involve employees in the
            early phases of your journey toward automation will help increase your chances of success as you adopt a
            self-service strategy that will transform your business.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As customers become more empowered to select goods and services that fit best into their
            lifestyle, it is imperative that businesses work harder to retain the customers they have. The cost of
            attracting new customers continues to increase, making it harder
            to grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It&#8217;s widely understood that it
            is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one&#8212;5x more!&#8212;depending
            on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
            industry.&amp;nbsp;This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score&lt;sup
            style="top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"&gt;&#174;&lt;/sup&gt;
            movement. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So, we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do
            that in such a competitive environment? &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s break it down, shall we?
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your customers&#8217; needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Take the time to know your customers&#8212;really&amp;nbsp;know them. Who are they? What do they
            really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires, what&#8217;s
            working and what isn&#8217;t, and how they feel
            about their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys, phone marketing, exit
            interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act on the data you gather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Change when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve.
            Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them.
            Provide alternative solutions where known issues
            exist. Proactively offer something (a discount, promo item, etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to
            provide feedback. Furthermore, it&#8217;s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback&#8212;options
            should include human interaction
            (phone or chat) and self-help (IVR, web or social). It&#8217;s your willingness and ability to connect with
            your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer&#8212;which
            directly impacts your ability
            to retain and grow your market share.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect your customers&#8217; time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each interaction you have with your customers should be natural, organic and personalized.
            Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists, and they are more likely to respond positively to a
            real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive
            audience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers&#8217;
            needs&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport&#8212;explain
            what you can and will do each step of the way.
            Ask questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on
            how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their
            business, let them get on with their
            day. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely, over-solicitation of new offerings that
            don&#8217;t fit their needs could push them to a competitor. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay relevant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It hardly needs to be said (but we&#8217;re going to say it anyway)&#8212;it&#8217;s&amp;nbsp;absolutely&amp;nbsp;&lt;span
            style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;critical&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;to understand your customers and your
            competition. The marketplace is constantly changing,
            and what customers see, and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the
            market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers
            or solutions become available, be
            sure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the
            perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid
            the fate of once&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/7-iconic-brands-no-longer-exist.asp"&gt;iconic
            brands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;no
            longer in existence. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So, let&#8217;s sum it up. To reduce costly customer churn, the key is to stay focused on and
            connected with the customers you have, listen and adapt to their feedback, respect their time and ensure
            your offers and solutions are competitively relevant.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of increased volumes and a growing need for Prior Authorization support, a
            leading Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) turned to us for help. Within a two-month timeframe, the client
            needed us to help scale and secure more than 500 additional licensed Pharmacy Technicians and 200 registered
            Pharmacists.

            Merriam&lt;/b&gt;, Global Client Solutions Director in Longwood, Florida, calls herself a &#8220;lifelong
            learner,&#8221; and credits that outlook with helping her attain her goals. The key to being a lifelong
            learner is to also be a lifelong
            listener. If you&#8217;re able to really listen, you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the
            status quo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working her way up in the BPO industry, she started out as an agent and then
            was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering
            before she moved into client solutions. Each new opportunity was a result
            of learning as much as she could in every role, and then pursuing the next challenge. Read her full Q&amp;amp;A
            below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: How have mentors made a difference
            in your career?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; My first office
            job was during college and involved filing papers. My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and
            beyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading
            their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether
            someone reports to me or I work with
            them, I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Looking back, did you see yourself
            reaching a director role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; Yes,
            I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward, but I think in life, your priorities change
            as you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for
            her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my
            perspectives widened, my leadership and
            listening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color:
            rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a
            woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28,
            1)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; In my life and career, I&#8217;ve
            had to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m female, a minority, my
            age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use
            effective communication, and make fact-based
            recommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152,
            82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory? Why or why not?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b
            style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I&#8217;ve made mistakes, I&#8217;ve suffered
            heartaches, I&#8217;ve fought hard and lost battles,
            but I can&#8217;t say I regret any of it. Every one of those things have been a learning experience,
            building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last-minute changes to the scope loomed menacingly, but by hiring specialty coaches,
            enlisting additional expert resources and reducing unnecessary service dispatches, a major communications
            provider &lt;strong&gt;saved millions of dollars&lt;/strong&gt; while observing
            a significant uptick in customer satisfaction. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Manage last-minute changes to program launch scope&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;Reduce expensive and unnecessary non-qualified service dispatches&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;Voice of the Customer scores outperformed internal domestic centers&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            When the Scope Flew Out the Window, We Swooped Into Action.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A major communications provider partnered with Alorica to create an inbound customer service
            program for billing and general inquiries. All was going smoothly, but two weeks prior to the end of
            new-hire training, the scope of work shifted. Alorica was
            tasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support, in order to help reduce unnecessary
            service dispatches. And then, one week after the launch, the scope increased to include upselling of
            ancillary products/services. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Good thing we&#8217;re all about overcoming adversity &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Sometimes, You Need Reinforcements.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Changes to the scope required us to make significant investments in additional coaching and
            leadership resources.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Sales-After-Service Coaches who specialize in Alorica&#8217;s solutions-based selling
            methodology were assigned to assist agents with selling on service calls. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Business Intelligence Analysts were hired to review call recordings and compare time spent
            in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for specific calls that
            resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch; the findings
            were forwarded with suggested coaching methods to reduce the number of costly and unnecessary service
            dispatches. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Voice of the Customer Coaches specializing in VOC solutions for detractors were assigned to
            work with agents having challenges with specific customer dissatisfaction categories &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Sometimes, You Need Added Bench Strength.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            It was critical to ensure that growth did not come at the expense of performance, so Alorica made bench
            strength investments by enhancing Leadership Development and Succession Planning.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; &lt;strong&gt;Early leadership assessments&lt;/strong&gt; of all agents helped workforce
            planning understand the potential bench strength available for ramps &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; &lt;strong&gt;Financial incentives&lt;/strong&gt; encouraged agents to enroll in Alorica&#8217;s
            &#8220;clear path&#8221; program for leadership development and leadership certifications &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; &lt;strong&gt;Systematic succession planning&lt;/strong&gt; established that managers would
            be eligible for promotion only when at least two of their subordinates were certified for promotion &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; &lt;strong&gt;Peer-to-Peer &#8220;Buddy System&#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; was founded, where
            each role, function and manager were paired up with a high-performing manager within the client&#8217;s
            internal contact centers &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica drove ticket quality and ultimately minimized the expense of dispatching to the client&#8217;s
            customers who truly required a service truck, by implementing a Ticket Quality Management group. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; We hired Ticket Quality Managers as business intelligence analysts to audit calls and
            systems, identify outliers and coach for improvements for non-qualified dispatches &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-dispatch auditing&lt;/strong&gt; identified Non-Qualified Dispatches prior to our
            client incurring the expense, by reviewing call recordings and comparing time spent in the interactive
            troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for
            specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Outlier identification&lt;/strong&gt; of the individual team (and site where the non-qualified
            dispatch originated) was gathered and analyzed&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Outlier coaching&lt;/strong&gt; was conducted to improve behaviors and avoid future
            non-qualified dispatches &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Being Nimble and Staying Committed&#8212;That&#8217;s how We Earn a Win. &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ability to react quickly to change played a major part in finding success with (and for) our
            client. Thanks to significant investment in additional coaching and leadership resources, our partnership
            with the client helped to: &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Exceed performance targets during and after launch &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Drive improvements to service ticket quality&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8226; Minimize the expense of dispatching to customers &#8230;talk about an insanely great
            ending.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Know your customer&#8221; has been a retail rallying cry for the past several
            decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers&#8217; likely
            buying behaviors, they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies
            focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; face is how to
            enhance and personalize the customer experience, so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer
            and the brand&#8212;regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But let&#8217;s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as
            &lt;em&gt;Social Media&lt;/em&gt;. What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the
            dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV, radio and print as the preferred media
            source for a growing percentage of the population, and as &#8216;cord cutters&#8217; continue to rise,
            advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services, and are being reallocated towards
            content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As these extensive technological changes continue, and growing consumer demand and the
            ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage, it&#8217;s
            imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for
            Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into
            your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock
            valuable consumer data, including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing
            decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their
            experiences, and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter
            decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care&#8212;the efforts of caring for
            customers using social media&#8212;is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers.
            Marketers, retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their
            customer journey by providing social media support, yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and
            quantitative value of their efforts.
            &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retailers are being pushed into social care by engaged, social-savvy consumers who are posting
            questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming,
            with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news, is that not
            all social posts are created equal&#8212;they don&#8217;t all require a response. Robust listening platforms
            along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and
            effective.&amp;nbsp;In addition, while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact,
            channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a
            customer asks a question in a channel that isn&#8217;t able to support an appropriate response. For example,
            if a customer asks a question on Twitter, the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry
            in 140 characters or less. For some context, the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise, a
            customer may need to share sensitive account information, thus requiring a more private, secure channel such
            as phone, chat or email.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered, it raises problems for
            measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately, there are technology
            platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program.
            Traditional social media metrics (&#8220;likes&#8221;, &#8220;followers,&#8221; etc.) are valuable, but they
            don&#8217;t necessarily provide insight into important areas&#8212;like the level of customer satisfaction
            across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are
            important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing
            channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your
            customer retention strategy.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lastly, consider partnering with your user community. It&#8217;s a good idea to deploy YouTube
            customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked
            questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z, YouTube can help you
            provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company&#8217;s overall support
            cost. Avenues for guided self-service, including video FAQs and tutorials, provide a path of great value for
            your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome&#8212;higher
            satisfaction levels for all customers, and a more strategic deployment of internal resources&#8212;both of
            which can impact your bottom and top lines.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s retailers stand at a crossroads&#8212;evolve existing practices to meet and exceed
            the expectations of your customers, or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you
            in the marketplace. Don&#8217;t let customers pass you by&#8212;start planning your social care, channel
            redirection and guided self-service strategy today&#8212;because your success depends on it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we launched Alorica&#8217;s first &#8220;&lt;a
            href="/news/detail/alorica-hosts-first-national-recruiting-day-to-support-26000-open-positions"&gt;National
            Recruiting Day&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; to support filling
            26,000 open positions in North America across more than 70 sites in the United States and Canada. We even
            received support from local media at sites in El Paso, Texas; Joplin, Mo.; Owensboro, Ky.; Saraland, Ala.;
            and St. Joseph, Mo. And while we had
            great turnout, we still have &lt;strong&gt;10,000&lt;/strong&gt; career opportunities to hire for by the
            beginning of next year! &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powered by personality, Alorica has redefined the contact center environment, offering a unique
            approach to its employee experience to reflect its people-first culture. Here are a few highlights:
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Career Progression &#8211; Working for Alorica is not just about having a job, but a purpose. In
            fact, many of our leaders, including site directors, VP and SVP of operations started on the frontlines as
            agents. We take the &#8220;your success is
            our success approach&#8221; for every team member, through a variety of ways in our training methodologies
            and mentoring, with the goal of helping employees perform at their best, define their career path and
            ultimately climb the ladder in the
            organization.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Culture Committee &#8211; At each of our 130 sites around the world, a select group of employees
            at all levels, plan on-site events, such as dress-up days and cookouts, help oversee celebrations and
            contests, and gain VIP access to company news to
            then spread to the local Alorica population.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livesbetter.org"&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt; (MLBA)
            &#8211; Our approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other. Through the non-profit MLBA, Alorica
            empowers its employees to give to those
            in need within their own communities. With approximately 100 MLBA chapters around the world, employees have
            the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and volunteering.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Game Changer &#8211; This companywide program recognizes employees who continually deliver
            insanely great customer experience while bringing Alorica&#8217;s vision, mission and promise to life. The
            awards are given out at three levels&#8212;site,
            regional and organizational.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;A Special Kind of Leadership &#8211; As part of our commitment to enhance the employee experience,
            Alorica appointed Tania King as Chief Employee Experience Officer, joining Joyce Lee, the company&#8217;s
            Chief Culture Officer.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, companies have relied on partnerships with contact center outsourcing
            providers to handle customer questions and resolve issues quickly&#8212;but the times, they are a changin&#8217;.
            As the tidal shift toward digital, non-voice methods of
            communication continues, no channel has resonated more strongly with customers than live chat; in fact, a
            recent report found that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/01/live-chat-statistics.html" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;demand for
            live chat features on company websites grew by 8.3% in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live
            chat allows businesses to connect in real-time with visitors on their website. This robust channel meets
            online users where they are, providing instant assistance while the customer is immersed in that online
            ecosystem. The ability to get information
            quickly without leaving the keyboard is a key benefit; of those who utilize Live Chat, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;79%
            do so because of the efficient nature of the platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, chat has the highest satisfaction rating among &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; customer
            service channels, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;73% of online
            consumers giving it the thumbs up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why
            so beloved? Here are four great reasons why customers embrace this customer service channel. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;#1: More convenient than drive-thru coffee&lt;/h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;Average customer wait times are generally much shorter in live chat than when calling in to a
            support line, and customers can multitask while waiting for a response. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.nextiva.com/blog/what-is-live-chat.html" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;The average response
            time is 2 minutes and 40 seconds, with the fastest response time being 7 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;compared
            to nearly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/how-long-do-callers-wait-before-they-hang-up/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;7
            minutes of wait time when calling in to a contact center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;#2:
            More connected than an Instagram Influencer&lt;/h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;Customer service reps using Live Chat can &lt;em&gt;co-browse&lt;/em&gt; (view a customer&#8217;s
            screen); this lets them see in real-time what they need to in order to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-does-live-chat-increase-efficiency-while-reducing-costs/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;troubleshoot the customer&#8217;s online issues with speed and efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;#3:
            More accurate than a laser-guided missile&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live chat makes it easy for agents and
            customers to share SKU numbers, general account information, confirmation codes and other important textual
            data&#8212;reducing the likelihood of errors. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;#4: More proactive than a devoted butler&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Chat lets
            agents serve up special offers to loyal customers or offer assistance; meanwhile a live preview of what the
            customer is typing provides agents with in-depth insights&#8212;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-does-live-chat-increase-efficiency-while-reducing-costs/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;before the customer has even finished typing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research
            shows that customers are as equally receptive to chat as a marketing tool as they are to use it for online
            support, and chat has been shown to drive customer loyalty. Consider these facts: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-power-of-live-chat-5-surprising-statistics-that-show-how-consumers-want-thei.html"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;44% of online consumers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;say
            that having questions answered
            by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website
            can offer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;79%
            of customers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; say they prefer live chat purely because of&amp;nbsp;the immediacy it
            offers&amp;nbsp;compared to other channels.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/live-chat-marketing/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;63% of consumers say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;they
            are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;more likely to make another purchase&lt;/strong&gt; from a website that offers
            live chat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live chat offers several benefits to e-commerce businesses and
            other companies. Online support tools enable the capture of valuable consumer data&#8212;such as last page
            viewed and common questions&#8212;that can reveal opportunities to improve the user
            experience. In addition, agents&#8217; ability to handle multiple conversations simultaneously can reduce
            average interaction costs. Equally important, offering live chat can increase conversion rates and reduce
            abandonment, since&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;77% of customers won&#8217;t make a purchase on a website if there&#8217;s no
            live chat option available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat is increasingly relevant and valuable as a support and sales channel; not only does
            it enhance the customer journey (leading to increased efficiencies and streamlined handling), it provides an
            opportunity to maximize the customer experience by &lt;strong&gt;engaging visitors who might&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;otherwise
            have left your website without making a purchase or ever asking for help&lt;/strong&gt;.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#8217;s something worth talking about.

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Otto The Discovery &lt;b&gt;BOT&#8482;&lt;/b&gt; Ushers in a New Era of Productivity&lt;/h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s customer experience agents handle more than ever. Freeing up your team to tackle&amp;nbsp;complex
            consumer interactions starts with automating routine and repetitive tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;And that&#8217;s
            where Otto The Discovery BOT&#8482; comes in.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is a Discovery Bot?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A
            robotic tool that helps identify the tasks, activities and sub-processes best&amp;nbsp;suited for
            automation. This is the first step towards Digital Transformation&#8212;and OTTO&lt;b&gt;&#8482;&lt;/b&gt;eliminates
            what would otherwise be a time-consuming
            period of&amp;nbsp;manually observing agents&#8217; steps and screens. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How Does it Work?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OTTO&#8482; does everything in the

            employee desktops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OTTO&lt;b&gt;&#8482;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;observes agent&amp;nbsp;behavior
            and applies &lt;b&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;to identify processes that are&amp;nbsp;ripe

            Discovery&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;BOT&#8482;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;so Special?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our
            proprietary&amp;nbsp;technology is only&amp;nbsp;half of the equation. &lt;b&gt;It&#8217;s the people&amp;nbsp;behind
            OTTO&#8482;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;that truly make the&amp;nbsp;tool valuable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our
            Business&amp;nbsp;Transformation&amp;nbsp;Team&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;analyzes all the&amp;nbsp;results, and&amp;nbsp;consults

        <description>&lt;em&gt;by J. Scott Nebel, Omaha 06&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            While any fundraising event that engages, unifies and raises money is a worthy effort, fundraising is not
            without its failures and frustrations. So here is ...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Part 2&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a title="MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)"
            href="mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"&gt;click here for Part 1&lt;/a&gt;):&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What
            Went Wrong&#8230;?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Flop Number&amp;nbsp;3: Car Wash&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Hose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait, where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash,
            only we're not really washing anything, so it's more of a "_", which I really don't know
            how to pronounce, but I'm pretty sure a "_" doesn't make any money! &lt;br&gt;
            We have succeeded and failed with car washes, but failure was always a result of&amp;nbsp;the planning and
            execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes:&lt;br&gt;
            TIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule
            more than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick, be pulled into emergency meetings, or
            get abducted by aliens (Seriously, it's been weeks. Where's Joe!) &lt;br&gt;
            TIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President
            of Corporate Suds and Towels, we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and
            start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out&amp;nbsp;how much staff you will
            need.
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Flop Number 2: Off-Site Events&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Off-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work,
            getting the name Alorica out into the community&#8212;it's a win-win, even if you make
            nothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about
            our employees and each other. But ... &lt;br&gt;
            TIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop.
            Whether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money
            either, but that's still marginally in the "win" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the &lt;a
            title="MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)" href="mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"&gt;Penny
            War&lt;/a&gt;...) &lt;br&gt;
            TIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you
            have active engagement
            across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer
            or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of
            communication. Never underestimate the power of
            a full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would
            (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance
            number. Also not really the best time for my
            first attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!)
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Number 1: Culture Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            "Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?"&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp;Yup.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            "Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?"&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Yup. &lt;br&gt;
            Pricing
            is a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling
            picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light
            ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof
            plan. &lt;br&gt;
            TIP1: I "math-ed" and you can, too!&amp;nbsp; Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful
            pricing:&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2c/p&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;aka Two times the &lt;span style="text-decoration:
            underline"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of &lt;span
            style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;articipants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            TIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation?&amp;nbsp; Worry not! We believe we've cracked that
            code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope
            that a cyborg from the future will come back
            in time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found
            that anticipated participation usually comes in around &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;25-33%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
            of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees
            (at least not when there is a charge... &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;FREE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;food
            is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!) &lt;br&gt;
            You'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you
            try some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become
            the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up &#8230; it&#8217;s easier to give change for whole
            dollars!&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;To Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four "P"s:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Plan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Promote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Party with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Peanut Butter! (Yeah, I really only had three "P"s, sorry.)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) has expanded its Latin America presence, launching
            in Panama! &lt;a
            href="https://livesbetter.org/global-non-profit-making-lives-better-with-alorica-can-now-share-the-love-into-panama-for-the-first-time/"&gt;MLBA
            Panama&lt;/a&gt;will
            start with two Chapters &#8211; Juan Diaz and Panama West at Alorica contact centers in Panama City. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MLBA is a separate 501(c)(3) non-profit entity that brings to life Alorica&#8217;s vision &#8211;
            to make lives better, one interaction at a time, by empowering Alorica employees to do exactly that &#8211;
            make lives better &#8211; for local causes and
            individuals. In total, MLBA now has 92 Chapters in five countries &#8211; Canada, Mexico, Philippines,
            United States and now Panama. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To celebrate the launch, ribbon cuttings were held at each new Chapter with Panama Country Manager
            Eduardo Heart and Regional HR Vice President Francisco Jorda leading the ceremonies. During each event,
            Samson Seelan, Employee Experience Regional Director,
            presented to the employees a background on MLBA, what the non-profit has accomplished in the past three
            years and introduced local representatives from each Chapter. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since its inception three years ago, employee-led MLBA chapters have raised more than $3.3 million
            dollars through Alorica payroll contributions and chapter fundraisers. Of the funds collected, more than
            6,00 grants have been awarded&#8212; totaling in
            excess of $2.8 million. In addition to these funds, the non-profit has collected nearly $300,000 for the
            MLBA Disaster Relief Fund, benefiting those affected by natural disasters. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To see how MLBA is changing the lives of Alorica employees, their families and the communities that
            support them, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.LivesBetter.org"&gt;www.LivesBetter.org&lt;/a&gt;. You can

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As customers become more comfortable using self-service for routine issues, and by 2025,
            85% of interactions with a business will exist without person-to-person communication. But this means that
            the calls that do come in tend to be more involved, and
            they require greater agent finesse and problem-solving skills. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While it&#8217;s important to deliver consistent client service on a regular basis, it can
            be difficult to do so without the proper technological infrastructure. As consumer demands continue to
            shift,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/news/detail/customer-care/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;customer care solutions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;teams
            are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons&#8217;
            needs. While these technologies create a faster, more flexible staff member,
            they also require special attention in some instances, since a breakdown can disrupt the entire
            infrastructure. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="/industries"&gt;customer relationship management technology&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;system, but in terms of
            systematic processes,
            finding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively
            troubleshoot its problems, they&#8217;re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction, among
            other things. With that in mind, here are
            four tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic
            issue: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Assuming
            typically doesn&#8217;t get anyone very far, so best practice &#8211; especially in the customer service
            industry &#8211; is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It
            can be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer
            contacts a business&#8217;s service center, especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation
            before. However, the idea of
            effective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from
            that point on. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The
            parlance of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/news/detail/customer-care/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;BPO technical
            support&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;representative
            will likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It&#8217;s
            important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The
            way a client describes something may
            make sense to him or her, but it very well could be the wrong way to&amp;nbsp;describe something from a
            business standpoint. Alternatively, a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when
            speaking with a patron, otherwise the internal
            vernacular may confuse the customer at hand. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Manage issues in order of their importance:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In a
            perfect world, nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team&#8217;s IT infrastructure, therefore
            eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However, since the
            human element is a constant in the client services equation, there are bound to be mistakes in the process.
            As a result, management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively, or else the most important
            issues won&#8217;t get taken care
            of first. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Cover all bases before taking action:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This can
            be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an
            immediate fashion, so it&#8217;s hard not to understand why a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="/news/detail/customer-care/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;contact center service&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;would
            want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet, it&#8217;s important that reps evaluate
            the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts
            with the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a
            longer process, but it will teach reps to double-check, cross reference and test things before the problem
            is addressed. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alorica Philippines plays host to over a dozen unique Alorica sites, which collectively
            recruit thousands of candidates per year. As ad campaigns evolve to reach job seekers through social media
            and other non-traditional channels, our Philippines teams
            have turned to chatbot recruitment automation technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified
            applicants and bring the right candidates in the door. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Download the case study to learn more. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Maximize online recruiting channels&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Candidates were being generated, but most leads were inactive&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;In just three months, we interviewed ~3,000 candidates&#8212;versus 966 that same period the year
            prior&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Saved more than 1,200 man-hours during a 3-month period&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cost-per-hire reduced by 84%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Online channel conversion rate 14-16%, versus traditional channels at 4-6%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting a Conversation by Speaking Their Language&lt;/strong&gt;
            To attract the best talent, we needed to find a way to talk to our talent pool in ways they preferred&#8212;enter
            chatbot. We began by embedding the tech into our Philippines
            Facebook page, and immediately we were handling simultaneous inquiries, providing real-time responses and
            conducting initial candidate screenings via Facebook Messenger. The best part? It all takes place 24/7,
            dramatically increasing the number of
            candidates we can assess and ultimately hire. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beyond simple introductory communication, our chatbot is able to facilitate in-depth Q&amp;amp;A
            sessions with applicants; their responses are easily accessed by recruiters who can follow-up with next
            steps by phone, preserving candidate excitement and increasing
            the likelihood of an in-person interview &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualified Candidates, Faster than Ever&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            Chatbots have completely changed our recruiting game. Not only have we saved money and manhours, but
            qualified candidates are unquestionably connecting with the company and
            resonating with our recruitment strategy. It just goes to show&#8212;the trick to getting face time is a
            little screen time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) is a non-profit organization,&amp;nbsp;and our
            approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other.&amp;nbsp;Most companies handle charitable giving from
            the top-down&#8212;but Alorica is&amp;nbsp;not like most companies.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLBA empowers Alorica employees to give to those in need within their own communities&#8212;allowing
            them to share the love with the people, and in the places, that matter most to them.&amp;nbsp;With nearly
            100 MLBA chapters around the world, employees have
            the decision-making power&amp;nbsp;to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and
            volunteering&#8212;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;100% of chapter contributions STAY with that chapter.&lt;/b&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when local areas are hit hard by natural disasters or other crises, MLBA
            assists&amp;nbsp;impacted employees, families and communities through our Disaster Relief Fund. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with offering support and encouragement at every touchpoint of the organization,
            Alorica&amp;nbsp;provides the administrative resources required to fuel this giving program as part of its
            corporate social responsibility initiative. &amp;nbsp; Take a look
            at some of the ways MLBA is making a difference:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homelessness Prevention&lt;/b&gt;&#8212;MLBA has stepped in to
            prevent evictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medical Assistance&#8212;&lt;/b&gt;MLBA provides
            assistance when medical&amp;nbsp;bills become overwhelming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disaster
            Relief&#8212;&lt;/b&gt;Over $200,000 raised to date when natural&amp;nbsp;disasters strike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funeral
            Expenses&#8212;&lt;/b&gt;We&#8217;ve been able to assist during the&amp;nbsp;most trying times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;How to Leverage the Feedback Economy to Provide Insanely Great Customer Service&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shep Hyken interviews Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer of Alorica. They discuss the feedback
            economy and how to leverage customer feedback to improve the
            &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt;customer experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a class="cta blue"

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;LISTEN TO PODCAST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Companies spend billions of dollars building their brands, retail stores, and products. But, when
            it comes down to the moment that&#8217;s most impactful for a customer, it usually comes down to their
            interaction with a customer service agent.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The feedback economy shifts the service model on its head. There is less focus on broadcasting why
            your company is great. The focus is on listening to the customer, understanding their pain points, and
            creating more systemic changes to address them.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;There are thousands of avenues for empowered consumers to make their voices heard. You need the
            right tools to harness all this feedback and take action.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Social channels don&#8217;t discriminate. Companies have to learn to change their processes,
            technologies, and products to be responsive. The customers need to be the center of a company&#8217;s
            strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Technology is only a piece of what it takes to get the customer service equation right. You need
            the right judgment and empathy to take action and help your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Customer service happens throughout the entire customer journey. The overall user experience is a
            function of an ecosystem of partners for delivery. Employees, and in some instances, companies need to
            collaborate to create a great &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt;customer experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Policies should be rules or guidelines that empower employees to help the customer instead of
            hindering service.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The customer is the center of everything that you do.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Always put the customer and their voice as your north star in how you think about providing
            service.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of the day, it comes down to listening. Leverage your socials and content reviews
            as business assets.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customer
            feedback is your biggest resource. The customer can guide you to your success.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt;Colson Hillier&lt;/a&gt; is
            the Chief Marketing Officer for Alorica. He oversees the planning, development, and execution of Alorica&#8217;s
            marketing and communications strategy,
            as well as initiatives tied to the company&#8217;s brand principles, value proposition, and revenue growth.

            questions &#8230; and more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;What is the feedback economy?&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;How do you use customer feedback to improve customer service?&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Can companies successfully outsource customer service?&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;How do you find out what people are saying about your company?&lt;/li&gt;

        <html:link rel="alternate" hreflang="en"
                   href="https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-do-analytics-factor-into-acquiring-retaining-customers"/>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Acquisition and Retention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s start with a couple facts. It&#8217;s been shown that: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;A 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Brand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers, and 7x more than detractors&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Companies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value, and encouraging a
            passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become
            passive&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;The truth is, many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what&#8217;s the
            solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new
            customers, but maintaining the customer relationships
            you already possess?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Simple. Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#8217;s Good to Get Analytical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large
            role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at
            the right time, increase your propensity to connect, convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in
            contact with your brand. In addition, analytics let companies personalize the customer experience, reducing
            the need for mass sales pitches or
            blanket selling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day, lead demographics
            and scoring, bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And
            yet, analytics are practically
            useless unless you can truly put them to work. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The sad truth is that analytics are often only reported, and not
            analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities,
            as potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists, predict
            propensity to connect and increase first-attempt
            connects, all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Access to analytics is important, but &lt;em&gt;analyzing&lt;/em&gt; the analytics &#8211; putting
            the data to work for you &#8211; that&#8217;s where the difference is made. It&#8217;s all about predictive
            models that leverage
            diverse sources of data such as text, survey responses, and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical
            Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households, which, when coupled with Alorica&#8217;s 30
            years of experience, allows us to fully
            analyze and interpret information &#8211; and not just merely spit out numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s how you gain customers. That&#8217;s how you &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; customers.
            Simply put, that&#8217;s what grows your company. And growing your company is what
            Alorica is all about. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our client, a hotel reservation company, was having continual staffing challenges. While
            spikes in volume weren&#8217;t uncommon, they needed a more flexible staffing model&#8212;one that allowed
            for new employee hiring, onboarding, and speed-to-proficiency

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in an age where everyone can have an online voice. And while that voice is often
            used to express joy, or excitement, or&#8230;&lt;i&gt;memes!&lt;/i&gt;... sometimes, the messages, videos
            and images posted are malicious, manipulative, false or downright

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another week and another round of stories that show how our incredible team members are
            helping each other, our clients and customers around the globe. We&#8217;re thrilled to share new stories
            filled with passion, performance and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long hours&#8212;and
            acknowledge accomplishments that truly shatter the status quo!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our insanely great teams in Guatemala have overcome countless obstacles&lt;/strong&gt;,
            including logistical issues and a mandated government curfew, but have quickly transitioned over a thousand
            team members to work-at-home. Not only that, but they
            did so in record time, overcoming their own hardships, with individuals coming together and continuing to
            move more team members to work-at-home to ensure we continue supporting our clients and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

            up, &lt;strong&gt;our amazing Aloricans from Owensboro&lt;/strong&gt; who work with one of our clients (a
            major credit card company) went above and beyond! The team that handles Trip Insurance had a flood of calls
            from customers needing to cancel their trips.
            Not only did they meet the challenge, but the other team who handles Membership Rewards pitched in to assist
            their co-workers with the overflow. Your cooperation, patience and focus on our customers in the face of
            this storm has truly makes us proud!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, recognizing the efforts made by &lt;strong&gt;our entire IT organization to
            migrate thousands of agents&lt;/strong&gt; all around the globe to Work-at-Home&#8212;in just a matter of
            days. &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very member of our IT team has worked tirelessly&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;to
            achieve this monumental accomplishment. Together, they&#8217;ve designed and implemented solutions that
            support our clients and keep our team members healthy and safe during such uncertain times. And they&#8217;re
            not done yet&#8212;we still have
            many more team members planned for transition with more moving to an at-home solution each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;d
            like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all our teams who have risen to the occasion&#8212;and for
            your continued dedication to our clients and their customers. Because of your tireless efforts, we haven&#8217;t

            established business or a brand new one&#8212;and if you&#8217;ve been challenged with more competition, bad
            customer ratings or contemplating a new corporate strategy, it&#8217;s the best chance you&#8217;ve got to
            change course.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Millennials from Mars? There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain
            this group&#8211;which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone&#8211;that one begins to wonder if
            they&#8217;re from another planet. While &lt;a href="/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;understanding and decoding this group&lt;/a&gt; is paramount, there are ways to
            create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The most important weapon
            is your employer brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an employer brand&#8230;and why
            should you care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a textbook definition, &lt;a
            href="https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;your
            employer brand&lt;/a&gt; is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the
            community think about
            you. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;It
            sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning
            and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working
            environment and culture
            like? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employer brand and &lt;a
            href="http://www.recruiting.com/blog/6-steps-building-employee-value-proposition" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;employee
            value proposition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job
            seekers have more
            choices than ever before.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to
            their friends and neighbors. And they&#8217;ve decided that they won&#8217;t work for a company with a bad
            reputation. In fact, in one study, almost
            &lt;a href="http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/cc/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;70% of candidates&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said they wouldn&#8217;t take a job with a
            company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
            how do you create a great employer brand? &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a truly compelling employer
            brand takes time. It&#8217;s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are
            four keys to building a strong employer brand over time. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key component #1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Take time for self-reflection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every
            company has an identity. &amp;nbsp;It will typically include elements of your brand&#8217;s purpose, your
            mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really
            get to know yourself. What&#8217;s
            important to your company, your CEO, your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to
            have)? Is yours a company where people actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work? Why or why not? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core
            elements of your company, warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key component #2:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Authenticity above all else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates&#8211;particularly
            millennials&#8211;hate liars. Don&#8217;t try to be something you&#8217;re not. The whole point of this
            exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a
            quality match
            there. As you develop your employer brand, stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key component #3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a purpose-driven EVP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your
            Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials
            in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
            their supervisors; engagement;
            authentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key component #4:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Become a great storyteller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You
            have a great employer brand and compelling EVP, but don&#8217;t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong.
            In the real world, &#8220;if you build it&#8221; people will not come. You need to become a great
            storyteller to capture the attention of millennials
            and bring them to you. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a &lt;a
            href="http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/secret-sauce-employer-brand/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&#8220;secret
            sauce&#8221; for how do this&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, it helps if your employer brand&#8217;s voice and
            creative designs appeal to
            your target candidates.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; But, make sure your designs reflect your company, too (see
            point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready, include them in all components of your talent acquisition
            strategies and engage millennials where they congregate
            (e.g., social media). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As companies fish in the same millennial
            talent pool, it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer
            brand, you can do just that. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCES

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alorica delivers customer service on behalf of the world&#8217;s largest and most
            respected brands, but we are so much more than a leading CX provider. We are a company of people, a company
            of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility
            is to ensure that every Alorican is engaged, inspired and nurtured to succeed. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alorica&#8217;s Chief Culture Officer, I don&#8217;t take this responsibility lightly.
            And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: &lt;strong&gt;Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless.
            Be True&lt;/strong&gt;. With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work
            full-time from our homes, these values have taken on an even greater significance. They&#8217;ve kept us
            united even as we physically work apart, and we&#8217;ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver
            insanely great customer service for many
            essential businesses&#8212;including contact tracing, food delivery and content moderation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a minority-owned business, Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced
            by underserved populations and communities. It&#8217;s why we stand up for those less fortunate, and it&#8217;s
            what led us to launch &lt;strong&gt;TIDE: Together for Inclusion, Diversity &amp;amp; Equity&lt;/strong&gt;.
            We&#8217;ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues
            that matter most to them. We&#8217;ve facilitated respectful, fair and open dialogues about tough issues
            like racism, bias, sexual and gender
            identity, mental health and more. And through them all, we&#8217;ve learned about our people. We&#8217;ve
            listened to their stories. And we&#8217;ve grown&#8212;together. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit
            partner, &lt;a href="https://livesbetter.org/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica
            (MLBA)&lt;/a&gt;, has supported team members around the world in times
            of crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions, each of our
            chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities&#8212;and to-date, we&#8217;ve given out almost
            &lt;strong&gt;$5M&lt;/strong&gt; in grants
            in six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic, it has been our duty and privilege to donate
            time and resources to our local communities&#8212;supporting causes and individuals in need. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these programs are certainly good for the soul&#8212;but are they good for the
            business? In one emphatic word, YES! Our &lt;a href="/corporate-social-responsibility/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)&lt;/a&gt; initiatives have had a tremendous
            effect on Alorica&#8217;s ability to hire and retain top talent. We&#8217;re committed to Impact Sourcing&#8212;through
            which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities.
            Giving people the chance to earn a living, support their families and make a difference in their
            neighborhoods is what it&#8217;s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right
            thing&#8212;and so what&#8217;s good for the
            community is also good for the bottom line. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&#8217;s not just our people that care about our efforts&#8212;our partners do too!
            Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR, and they want to team up with like-minded
            corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility
            align, great partnerships are forged&#8212;and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible
            relationships based on shared values. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible, and it&#8217;s an honor
            to lead Alorica&#8217;s efforts in serving the common good. I&#8217;m incredibly proud of what we&#8217;ve
            achieved in a short amount of time, but we&#8217;ve only
            just begun&#8212;and there are awesome things to come!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want to know how thousands of your customers feel about your brand in real time? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or what about how you can identify ineffective self-serve tools and broken operational
            processes to reduce call volume?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#8217;ll find answers to these and other questions in
            the capabilities of Alorica&#8217;s enhanced data and CX solutions. We&#8217;ve tossed small sample surveys
            and other old-school tools into the trash and incorporated Verint&#8217;s Speech Analytics
            technology into our global digital platform. That means millions more insanely great experiences for our
            client&#8217;s customers as we reduce call volume, churn and improve customer satisfaction. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it work? By analyzing the voice recordings of incoming customer calls on a
            massive scale and with fuller insights than random surveys and manual processes. We can share with our
            clients what nearly every one of their customers think, feel, want
            and need in real time. Imagine the possibilities &#8212; like proactively engaging potential detractors
            based on their common calling and speech patterns. The potential for deeply enhancing the customer
            experience is boundless! &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This call may be monitored or recorded for quality or training purposes.&#8239;We&#8217;ve
            all heard this line; it&#8217;s just like when you walk into a store and see a sign saying,&#8239;Smile, you&#8217;re
            on camera! &#8239; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Knowing that someone may be listening or watching is an opportunity for both customer and employee
            to contribute to a smooth interaction. And if that interaction is negative or unproductive in some way, we
            can use technology to reveal what went wrong.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like surveillance video, tracked call data is essentially a gift bestowed by your customers.
            Through their speech and behavior patterns, we can extract valuable insights and build plans for future
            improvements. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In times of great uncertainty, it&#8217;s important to recognize and celebrate our
            incredible team members around the world. Within only days, we&#8217;ve successfully transitioned &lt;em&gt;thousands
            &lt;/em&gt;of agents to an at-home environment&#8212;and more
            are coming online each day! We&#8217;re thrilled to take this opportunity to share new stories filled with
            passion, performance and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long hours&#8212;and acknowledge accomplishments that
            truly shatter the status quo! &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-rich-text-format-boundary="true"&gt;Our entire Austin site has converted
            to a work-at-home environment&lt;/strong&gt;! And it wasn&#8217;t easy. Starting last Sunday, Sr. Site
            Director Tony Pi&#241;on, his management team and the client were on-site
            getting systems ready. The team then spent all of Monday and Tuesday deploying hundreds of production, ABAY
            and support staff into the at-home environment. Tony shared that the tremendous achievement wouldn&#8217;t
            have been possible without everyone
            banding together&#8212;including the entire Austin management team, all the incredible agents, corporate
            partners and executive leadership. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong
            data-rich-text-format-boundary="true"&gt;Next up, our Honduras site was just beginning to celebrate a
            partnership with a brand-new client&lt;/strong&gt;, when the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 threatened to bring
            business to a halt. But&#8212;our team snapped
            into action and immediately started testing remote access by sending one agent home to log-in. When that
            worked, they mobilized a few more agents, and once they were confident in the solution, they contacted the
            client to share the good news. The
            client was incredibly impressed with their proactive resolution, and soon the rest of the pieces fell into
            place. Site leadership determined which agents in the site met the requirements to work from home, launched
            training for the eligible employees
            (two weeks early, in fact!), and transitioned a great number of employees to Work-from-Home. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

            data-rich-text-format-boundary="true"&gt;Finally, we have an incredible story to share from our Newport News
            site!&lt;/strong&gt; After quickly surveying their entire team to confirm who met the technology
            requirements to work remotely, site leaders made
            it happen in record time&#8212;and transitioned more than a hundred employees in just a couple days! And
            they&#8217;re not stopping there&#8212;hundreds more employees are expecting to start working at home by the
            end of week. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to say congratulations
            to all our teams who have risen to the occasion&#8212;and to say thank you for your continued dedication to
            our clients and their customers. Because of your tireless efforts, we haven&#8217;t

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On any given day, 3.5 billion people are online&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;worldwide&#8212;and
            considering the global population is 7.7 billion, that&#8217;s a whole lot of people interacting and
            transacting worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the proliferation of mobile phones&#8212;in the United
            States alone, there are 106 mobile phones per 100 people&#8212;and the sustained popularity of social media
            websites like Facebook and Instagram, getting online has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#8217;s
            good news and bad news for customers and corporations.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;More People,
            More Problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many people online, with multiplatform access 24/7/365,
            the potential for serious risk has increased exponentially. Online attacks take place every 39 seconds; and
            a staggering 59% of U.S. teens have been cyberbullied or threatened online&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
            In just the past year alone, 69% of people have experienced online risks, including cyberbullying, hate
            speech, and threats of violence&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&#8217;s not just people
            who are at risk&#8212;over 55% of companies reported an increase in fraud-related losses&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Companies
            also suffer regulatory and financial
            penalties from data breaches, from the 2014 data breach that cost Home Depot $179 million to Target&#8217;s
            more recent $18.5M payout in 2017&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="inherit"
            size="-1"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Social media companies have found themselves particularly liable in recent years.
            The FTC regularly imposes multi-million dollar fines against them&#8230;and contrary to common assumptions,
            Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency
            Act does not provide protection from being held liable for bad behaviors on their platforms&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
            it&#8217;s not just steep fines (and the bad publicity that comes with them) that companies have to worry
            about&#8212;because with each incident, reputations suffer. Bearing in mind that approximately one in five
            customers would stop shopping with
            retailers whose data was hacked and stolen, online risks can have devastating consequences to a company&#8217;s
            bottom line, from the largest big-box retailer to the local boutique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust &amp;amp;
            Safety strategies&#8212;of which content moderation is an essential tool&#8212;can help keep company
            information accurate and customers safe, even in an ever-changing, crowded online landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding
            Legal and Reputational Risks (and How to Prevent Them)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much at stake,
            companies need to prioritize risk mitigation. And to effectively meet the expectations of consumers,
            employees, and investors, that means adopting effective risk management programs based on actionable
            insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can companies determine what their risks are, let alone know how to
            adopt formal programs that touch every aspect of their organizations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help guide
            companies towards successful risk management efforts, we hosted a webinar dedicated to assessing
            organizational legal and reputational risks for actionable insights, featuring Adam Dorfman, VP of Product
            at Reputation.com, Joe Buggy, Alorica&#8217;s
            Head of Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and Harry Folloder, SVP Chief Digital Officer at Alorica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            spirited, roundtable discussion covered a wealth of information, from explaining the nuances of assessing
            risk and best practices to AI&#8217;s role in reputation management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways
            included:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc" style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legal vs. reputational:&lt;/b&gt;
            As exemplified by Home Depot and Target, legal risks can include lawsuits, judgements, and financial harm;
            reputational risks include the erosion of trust and customer losses.
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive risk assessment&lt;/b&gt;: Companies
            that regularly conduct risk assessments can stay one step ahead; this means seeking out customer feedback
            versus waiting for negative content to flourish online. Active monitoring and listening to customers
            in real time builds trust and helps ensure that negative, reputation-damaging online feedback is addressed
            quickly and effectively. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk management adoption&lt;/b&gt;:
            Using frameworks helps companies decide how to approach risk management, including the total number of
            risks, percentage of organization affected, how have risks been mitigated historically, how many risks are
            monitored,
            and how many are mitigated. And once risks are assessed, have a process in place to help you plot and
            understand the scope each presents to the organization as a whole. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0"
            data-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Practices&lt;/b&gt;: By responding quickly to customer feedback online&#8212;within
            24 hours for negative feedback, and two days for positive feedback&#8212;companies show customers that they&#8217;re
            listening to them, which positively impacts
            both sentiment and retention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The role of AI&lt;/b&gt;:
            While AI can be a great tool for businesses, it also allows spam to proliferate; companies can circumvent
            potential risks by shifting to video testimonials, confirmed customer prioritization, or just by adding
            check marks to
            customers or purchases to add validation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Just Do
            Something&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest takeaway from our panel discussion was that when
            it comes to mitigating risks, companies can&#8217;t sit on the sidelines. They must act&#8212;and act fast&#8212;or
            they&#8217;ll face serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acting starts with companies understanding that
            there are external forces out there that can do serious harm to their bottom lines, and tracking risks
            accordingly. That doesn&#8217;t have to mean creating Risk Mitigation departments&#8212;simply asking
            exploratory questions to identify risks and creating a spreadsheet to track them can put companies on the
            path to less risks and happier customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To experience the full discussion, click &lt;a

            &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s Women&#8217;s History Month y&#8217;all!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a mother of six, wife of one and woman among millions, if I can give any advice to all the
            ladies out there, it is to lead by example. I&#8217;m so grateful to work at a company like Alorica where I&#8217;m
            personally encouraged to be bold, and my
            teams run with it when I challenge them to do the same. Because after 30 years in the biz, I can say with
            certainty that YOU are your best advocate, and you have the power to make things happen for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When I first started out as a call center agent in my 20&#8217;s, I didn&#8217;t know it would take
            me to where I am today&#8212;the President of North America and Europe Operations for &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/"&gt;one of the largest digital CX providers in the world&lt;/a&gt;.
            But I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their
            promise and then going for those new, kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example
            and lead in the same way. So, don&#8217;t
            wait for someone to come tap you. Never say &#8220;no&#8221; to a chance to learn more skills. Make
            mistakes, learn from them, and move on. As I often say, &#8220;get over it.&#8221; You never know where the
            next opportunity lies when you do these
            things. Most importantly, don&#8217;t follow a career path; build the one that&#8217;s meant for you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias&#8212;the theme
            celebrated around the world for International Women&#8217;s Day. Furthering &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion"&gt;diversity and inclusion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is,
            and should be, a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do, it enhances our business,
            company culture, and especially our people. At Alorica, we even have the numbers to prove it&#8212;our
            female population has grown since last
            year with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that, but as the largest certified and
            award-winning minority-owned BPO, we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce
            to 71%. Why are these facts important?
            Because strong representation of groups, such as women and minorities, matter to our employees, our clients
            and our customers&#8212;even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as
            a company, we are making progress.
            There&#8217;s much work to be done, but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As we continue Women&#8217;s History Month, I&#8217;d like to take a moment to celebrate some
            qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion, sensitivity and resilience when
            dealing with change. These qualities, which have
            sometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness, actually demonstrate our strength. We aren&#8217;t
            afraid to show these skills with conviction, strong execution and thoughtful leadership, and sometimes
            wearing bright-red heels. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE&#8230;watch
            me!&lt;/p&gt;

            between Central and South America, Panama is famous for its engineering phenomenon, the Panama Canal; it&#8217;s
            the only place in the world where you can see the sun rise on the Pacific and set on the Atlantic; and is
            home to three Alorica locations
            &#8211; Panama West, Juan Diaz 1 and Juan Diaz 2. So why the geography history? Well our next Aloricans in
            Action is from here! Introducing Yorlenys Macias, Onboarding Specialist for Panama and Uruguay, located at
            our Juan Diaz 1 site. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yorlenys has been an Alorican for 10 years, starting her
            career as an agent. The past decade has brought Yorlenys a fruitful career due to her positive attitude,
            friendliness and passion for &lt;i&gt;making lives better&lt;/i&gt;. Learn more about this loud and
            proud Alorica ambassador below:

            your background and career path at Alorica.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; My background is in business. I
            have my bachelor&#8217;s degree in Business Administration and a master&#8217;s degree in
            Project Management. I started at Alorica on the frontlines for a global communications client in 2009. With
            no prior contact center experience, I was nervous about not meeting expectations, but with a lot of learning
            and passion for what I do, I won
            the site Agent of the Year award the following year! This was a huge milestone for my professional career,
            opening doors to Quality Assurance and Trainer roles. With support from my mentors, in 2018, I became the
            Onboarding Specialist for Panama,
            and was recently assigned to add Uruguay to my responsibilities too. I&#8217;m also a Culture Champion for
            my site and a proud member of the MLBA Juan Diaz chapter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What professional advice can you give to employees who are just starting out?
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Here are my top three tips:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be yourself! Don&#8217;t ever pretend to be someone you&#8217;re not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use
            every opportunity to learn, and look at mistakes as opportunities to become a better version of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empower
            others, no matter their role or gender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What
            is your favorite thing about working at Alorica? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I love Alorica's
            commitment to constantly creating an amazing work environment. The culture is truly one of a kind. I really
            appreciate the
            support of Andy, Joyce and all of my colleagues over the past decade.
            &lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&#8217;s
            most rewarding in your role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;The most rewarding aspect of my role is
            feeling empowered to have a voice and being given the chance to significantly contribute to the
            overall growth of the company. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What motivates you every day? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
            I am motivated mainly by my parents who have always supported and encouraged me to become better every day.
            If it wasn&#180;t for their hard work, I would have
            never become who I am today. My family will always be my biggest motivation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way
            who were impactful? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Yes, I will always be thankful to all my Trainers,
            Supervisors, Operation Managers, and my current Direct Manager, Samson
            Seelan, who has opened my eyes to new opportunities. I&#8217;ll be forever grateful for their guidance and I
            can&#8217;t thank them enough for their trust and encouragement. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you tell us future goals for yourself, your team
            or the company? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; My goal is to keep inspiring others and to champion a
            workplace full of insanely great opportunities. I truly believe that
            every day may not be good, but there is always something good in every day. Keep smiling, set goals and
            fight the obstacles. And if we can all do this, I&#8217;m sure we can do a ton of great things.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As globalization continues to reshape the way businesses operate, workforce is becoming
            increasingly more diverse, bringing in a unique perspective of innovative thinking and cultural expertise.
            But to attract and retain this diverse talent, we need to
            focus on creating a culture of inclusivity that encourages individuality. Here are some of the benefits of
            being part of a global company with an inclusive mindset.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Exploring
            new markets with confidence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the era where global presence
            has become a defining element of success. A diverse talent pool enables companies to harness the cultural
            knowledge of their employees, thereby understanding the local nuances that
            are an integral part of consumer behaviors and preferences. This helps brands penetrate new markets
            effectively and stay ahead of anticipated risks while exploring new opportunities. Our operational footprint
            across NA, APAC, LATAM and EMEA enable
            us to best support our customers worldwide with&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;#LimitlessPossibilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Empowering growth&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Employees want to do their best work for leaders they trust and respect.&lt;/i&gt;
            An inclusive leadership team is a key selling point for recruiting best-in-class talent and boosting a
            company&#8217;s reputation as an employer of choice. Employees excel
            in their performance when they feel encouraged to be their true selves in their workplace, and when they see
            diversity within their leadership team. Alorica is proud to be a certified diverse supplier with strong
            minority and female representation
            around the world. Last year, we promoted 5,000 employees globally and more than half were women. We were
            also specifically recognized earlier this year for our Achievement in Promoting &amp;amp; Developing Women.
            &lt;b&gt;#EnhancedPerformance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Supporting communities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making
            lives better starts with individuals but extends much farther than that. &lt;/i&gt;Inclusivity goes beyond
            workplace dynamics. By providing opportunities to local employees from all walks of life&#8212;different
            ages, ethnicities, genders, interests,
            skills, education&#8212;to interact with, solve problems for customers, and grow professionally, companies
            have a positive ripple effect that impacts communities. This is seen through job creation, economic
            development, corporate social responsibility
            contributions and more. As an example,&amp;nbsp; as part of our skilling program in India, we also hire
            undergraduates and offer extended skills training for career advancement. &lt;b&gt;#PassionatePeople&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
            can confidently say that one of Alorica&#8217;s top differentiators is our people and the corporate culture
            we&#8217;re building together. As we expand our footprint, we remain committed to fostering inclusivity
            across the teams we support and in collaboration
            with our fellow colleagues around the world and by doing so, we&#8217;re making our Brand Promise come true&#8212;Passion.
            Performance. Possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

                   href="https://alorica.com/insights/resource/chat-with-our-chatbot-the-future-of-recruitment"/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oxford dictionary defines a chatbot as 'a computer program designed to simulate
            conversation with human users, especially over the internet.' As is often the case with new technology, many
            initial chatbots were created for fun, but they&#8217;re now being
            used to enhance the workplace, particularly in HR departments. How you ask? Job interviews can be incredibly
            stressful for applicants. Chatbots provide a level of comfort and, ironically, emotional distance that can
            promote efficient and relaxed conversations.
            Recruitment chatbots can stage initial interviews that are direct, friendly, and minimally intimidating. It&#8217;s
            also simply a better, faster and easier way to connect with qualified candidates. This is a win-win for both
            applicants and HR teams. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Alorica, we have been testing this method of recruitment in the Philippines by
            embedding the technology onto the Alorica Philippines Facebook page, conducting screenings via Facebook
            Messenger. To measure the effectiveness of this method, the technology
            had to solve the following challenges: maximize online recruiting channels; generate inactive leads; and
            reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads. In the span of just three months, the results have
            already been overwhelmingly positive! During
            the testing period, 3,088 candidates were interviewed, compared to 966 during the same period a year prior.
            There was a savings of more than 1,200 recruiting man hours and the cost per hire reduced by 84 percent.
            Additionally, online channel conversion
            rate was up to 14-16 percent compared to traditional channels at 4-6 percent. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To
            sum it up, chatbots have completely changed the way Alorica thinks about recruiting. By implementing the
            technology, we have not only saved money and man hours, but
            allowed us to connect with qualified candidates who resonated with this recruitment strategy. It just goes
            to show, the trick to getting face time is a little screen time. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica is
            one of the biggest outsourcing employers in the region with 17
            sites strategically located across metro Manila and provincial regions. If you are in the Philippines and

        <description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Recent health care regulations have made it difficult for sales reps and
            marketing personnel to meet with doctors on an individual basis. "No-see" and "hard to see" have become
            industry buzzwords in regards to medical practitioners since securing face
            time with them has become a challenge. As physicians - and fluid regulations - continue to restrict access
            to outside reps, the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with
            patients and less time being solicited.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p4"&gt;According to a study by Doctors.net.uk,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="52 percent of the more
            than 1,000"
            href="http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;52 percent of
            the more than 1,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;general
            practitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week, while just 26
            percent only saw one rep in the same time period. No-see doctors are impacting the medical field in a way
            that is negative for big pharmaceutical
            companies, but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps, they can focus more on patient health.
            A general lack of time was cited as the No. 1 reason why doctors don't see sales reps anymore, with 38
            percent of respondents saying they were
            too busy to meet with sales executives. Another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice
            policy.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No-see doctors mean industry wide changes&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This
            shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry, not just sales and marketing reps. Patients are
            beneficiaries of no-see doctors because they see more individual attention, but on the other
            hand, practices aren't able to take in as many patients as they used to, hence limiting business to a
            certain extent. On the back end of operations, doctors now have to manually enter patient information into
            electronic health record databases and
            submit prescriptions themselves, so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a
            result, according to Clark Ridge, vice president of client health care services at Alorica.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p3"&gt;"The level of accuracy, receiving greater scrutiny, I think you're just saying spend a
            little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right," Ridge said. "To a
            doctor, though, it's had a negative impact on their ability to
            generate revenue because it's reduced the number of people they're able to see."&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ridge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies, such as reimbursement rates
            determined by patient satisfaction scoring, the trickle-down effect of no-see and hard-to-see doctors may be
            more wide-sweeping than first thought. No longer are general
            physician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long
            periods of time before they see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsourced assistance could prove useful&lt;/strong&gt; Now that doctors
            are spending more time with each patient, chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized
            experience. On the front end of doctor's office visits, practices have been implementing
            streamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments. For example, individuals can now go
            online and book a time to visit their physician, and when they show up for their consultations, they can
            check-in using an automated kiosk.
            Although the adoption of the electronic sign-in has been slow, Ridge said it could greatly benefit the
            practices that implement such systems.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p class="p3"&gt;"To really take advantage of efficiency, outsourcing some of that interaction to a group
            of individuals that don't have to be on-site and can capture the information is a much less costly
            alternative," he said. "Where completeness and accuracy are key,
            outsourcing is a great option."&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

            &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOURCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p3"&gt;1&lt;br&gt;http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566&lt;/p&gt;

                   href="https://alorica.com/insights/resource/outsourcing-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-company"/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/"&gt;over
            2.3 million jobs were outsourced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It&#8217;s an increasingly popular way
            to do business; by freeing up internal resources,
            costs are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren&#8217;t
            generally available internally. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how
            do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution? &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read on, dear friends. Read on. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Six Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense&lt;/h3&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h4&gt;1. You want to retain customers.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Your current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain &#8211; and improve
            &#8211; an already exceptional level of service. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that
            allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions &#8211;
            chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not
            yet been considered). &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;2. You want to acquire new customers.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and
            retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide
            resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes &#8211; as it turns out, we are
            experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent
            profile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind &#8211; companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer
            engagement strategies see, on average, a &lt;a
            href="http://aberdeen.com/research/8675/ra-omni-channel-experience/content.aspx"&gt;9.5% increase in annual
            revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;3. Specialized training requires detailed education.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Certain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be
            time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there&#8217;s just too much for one trainer to know &#8211;
            but additional coaching can&#8217;t be supported by
            your in-house team. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients
            to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA
            analysts to ensure goals are met. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don&#8217;t have hundreds of extra
            seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp
            effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar,
            work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions.
            We excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you&#8217;re always
            staffed with the most qualified talent. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast &#8211; and thoughtful &#8211;
            solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled
            by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses
            the ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the
            flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp
            up and down quickly and allowing you to return
            to focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;You don&#8217;t have all the tech you need.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SITUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not
            customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted
            to a single channel, you&#8217;re missing out on opportunities
            to enhance customer experience and loyalty. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BPOs have deep experience with analytics &#8211; going beyond the raw data and providing useful
            analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple
            customer service channels &#8211; voice, email,
            chat, text, video and social media &#8211; customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term.
            &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Your company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values.
            Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless, blended partnership that benefits both sides. &lt;br&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the largest home warranty companies in the US (and a long-standing client) offered
            us an opportunity to pitch for a new line of business that was ramping quickly&#8212;so we needed to bring
            our A-game. Thanks to the outstanding
            relationship we enjoyed with this client&#8212;and because of our expertise, capabilities and experience&#8212;they
            trusted our ability to quickly and successfully launch their program in the Philippines. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Said the client:&amp;nbsp;&#8220;Alorica has been providing on-shore services to us for a
            significant amount of time. The decision was recently made to explore using a BPO provider offshore in the
            Philippines. The Alorica team effectively worked through multiple
            obstacles, and the fact that they were able to beat the already aggressive timeline is something that the
            project team should be very proud of.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read our case study and learn how&amp;nbsp;we can deliver for our clients and expand their business&#8212;whether

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a result of the average attention span being reduced to a mere eight seconds, people
            today are accustomed to finding an answer from a quick search. This is where microlearning comes in &#8211;
            it meets this expectation of consuming information, while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way
            of teaching and delivering content in small bursts, microlearning has been a key success factor for our
            agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider.
            &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, this pharmacy provider began to experience some
            challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant, ranging from financial
            loss to medication abuse, and in this highly-regulated industry, it was simply unacceptable. To fix the
            problem, Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved
            process compliance, but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it,
            microlearning.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation, we
            implemented microlearning &#8212; where we created a customized, brief, 10-minute video allowing agents to
            understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so, this helped close the culture gap to better
            align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program, we began collecting data on the
            effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves &#8211; the compliance rating improved to
            as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving &#8212; with an average of four training hours per full-time
            employee.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this new training method, the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed
            other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is
            microlearning&#8217;s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information, while
            encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore, these microlearnings were
            cost-effective, resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral, salary for
            trainers, etc.).
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We know your business has unique customer needs and we&#8217;re here to make sure our agents who
            provide customer service on your behalf are fully informed and engaged to make lives better, one interaction
            at a time. Email us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@Alorica.com"&gt;info@Alorica.com&lt;/a&gt; to understand how

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alorica successfully collaborated with OHSU to improve the patient experience through
            combined hospital and physician billing. In the end, OHSU achieved a &lt;b&gt;94%+ patient satisfaction
            rate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combine
            billings&lt;/b&gt; for hospital and physician&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Address billing&lt;/b&gt;
            workflow issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Align OHSU mission and values&lt;/b&gt; with customer
            service responses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve and simplify&lt;/b&gt; patient experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;94% patient
            satisfaction&lt;/b&gt; rate achieved&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workflow automation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stabilized
            Accounts Receivable and bad reserve debt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;64% physician billing&lt;/b&gt;
            liquidation rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;49% hospital billing&lt;/b&gt; liquidation rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeply committed to providing excellent patient care, OHSU stands
            out as a leader in the healthcare industry. As part of their commitment to the patient experience, OHSU
            sought to simplify patient billing by combining hospital and physician charges into
            a single, streamlined statement. To launch their vision, OHSU selected state-of-the-art Electronic Health
            Record (EHR) technology from EPIC software. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified, Rapid Response Stabilizes A/R and Improves
            Workflow Processes. By aligning talent from both sides, OHSU and Alorica worked together to correct the
            impeding issues, and successfully completed the conversion to EPIC. We further assisted by developing
            enhancements to the EPIC interface that helped maximize efficiencies and create &#8220;safety nets&#8221;&#8212;these
            safety nets, including exception reporting, identified accounts that were not moving through the self-pay
            workflow as expected and
            created a more stable environment. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhancements included:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li
            style="list-style-type: none"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workflow Automation&lt;br&gt;That used EPIC data
            fields to support outbound call campaigns and end-of-lifecycle timelines based on patient billing levels and
            statement dates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reconciliation Automation
            &lt;br&gt;That allowed recognition of returned mail, payment plans and statement suppression to ensure
            workflows were functioning correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post-conversion clean-up
            &lt;br&gt;With Alorica resources strategically placed to accelerate recoveries and reduce A/R days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transparent
            Reporting and Business Intelligence
            &lt;br&gt;Provided regular updates to OHSU on where payments were in the lifecycle, as well as helped
            forecast future revenue recovery rates; bad debt forecasting provided the road map to timelines needed to
            communicate stabilization of the post-conversion
            clean-up.
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predictive Analytics&lt;br&gt;Better identified a patient&#8217;s propensity
            to pay, and further customized outbound efforts to improve liquidation results and patient satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continued Efforts Further Improve Patient Experience and Workflow Processes:&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;OHSU and Alorica continue to apply thought leadership to improving the patient experience through
            quarterly business intelligence reviews. So far, these efforts involve: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patient Satisfaction Surveys To gather feedback and provide further insights
            into improving the combined hospital/physician billing statements and overall patient satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scripting
            Modifications For our customer service representatives and IVR messages to further align and project the
            OHSU mission and values &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As America was lurching towards economic instability earlier this year, Everest
            Group analysts published &lt;i&gt;Rethinking Trust and Safety: Six Strategies for Enterprises to Convert the
            Recession into an Opportunity&lt;/i&gt;, a series of recommendations to help
            companies navigate uncertain times.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their
            recommendations included multiple areas in Alorica&#8217;s wheelhouse, including:&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Considering
            outsourcing as an option. &lt;/b&gt;As Everest Group&#8217;s analysts observed, outsourcing is more
            cost-effective for companies no matter the economic climate. Outsourcing Trust &amp;amp; Safety initiatives,
            including content moderation
            and content management, empowers multi-dimensional, multilingual content moderation at scale&#8212;something
            we, as a veteran BPO industry leader, can easily attest to. As we&#8217;ve found, by acting as an extension
            of a client&#8217;s
            business, we&#8217;ve been able to provide seamless support while improving the customer experience without
            incurring risks for our clients.&#8239;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identify
            the most viable shoring mix. &lt;/b&gt;Going offshore (and nearshore) for Trust &amp;amp; Safety efforts
            makes dollars and sense per Everest Group&#8217;s analysis. As they note, even large tech firms have been
            shifting their content
            management and related needs to cost-effective locations in APAC and LATAM. In our experience, by leveraging
            our global workforce and delivery models, including work-at-home, hybrid, and gig workforce solutions,
            clients can empower safe
            spaces online, as well as maximize ROI in any economic climate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage
            alternative talent models for non-sensitive work types within Trust &amp;amp; Safety. &lt;/b&gt;Having a
            diverse workforce mix makes content moderation and other Trust &amp;amp; Safety initiatives manageable; and,
            as Everest Group rightly notes,
            hybrid workforces featuring full-time and gig workers have become increasingly common in the post-Covid-19
            landscape. Outsourcing optimized, global workforces like Alorica&#8217;s empowers companies to safeguard
            online communities with
            ease; we also invest heavily in our employee wellbeing to ensure that our talent is always up to the task.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adopt a
            pragmatic approach to digital investments.&lt;/b&gt; Large technology firms often partner with third-party
            service providers to leverage their talent pools and harness new technologies. Outsourcing, as Everest Group
            illustrates, makes
            it possible for companies of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technologies to improve content moderation
            and customer support simultaneously. Alorica&#8217;s clients and their customers enjoy the latest technology
            and optimal support
            without impacting their bottom lines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is just the beginning, per Everest Group,
            because outsourcing Trust &amp;amp; Safety also helps reduce attrition, creates more resilient workforces,
            and reduces portfolio risks&#8212;all things we couldn&#8217;t agree with more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, a major retail pharmacy provider
            began to experience some slipping in prescription fulfillment compliance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The client came
            to us in search of an effective learning intervention, and we
            presented them with the concept of microlearning. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With a group that was skeptical of new approaches to training, you could say we had a lot to prove
            using microlearning. Challenge accepted. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Introduce &#8216;microlearning&#8217; to revolutionize training protocols&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Boost KPI scores&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Win over a skeptical client&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Pilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by
            as much as 62%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Microlearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day.&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            This one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to
            improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site&#8217;s
            team was made up
            of Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of
            new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Challenge accepted. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores.&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            Instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention &lt;em&gt;marathons&lt;/em&gt;, we championed &lt;strong&gt;microlearning&lt;/strong&gt;:
            a short, animated video that focused
            on client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories
            assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a
            culture gap to better align with client
            expectations. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microlearning Makes Its Mark.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Thanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using
            traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning&#8217;s
            digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging
            participation and conversation during training sessions. Furthermore, microlearning is cost-effective,
            minimizing the need for traditional classroom training
            and ultimately cutting development costs by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Alorica&#8217;s Commitment to CSR&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing, and taking care of one another, is an integral part of who we are&#8212;and
            we live up to these mandates through charitable giving, social impact and environmental sustainability.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica was built on three P&#8217;s&#8212;Passion, Performance and Possibilities. But when it
            comes to CSR, we focus on another three: Philanthropy, People and Planet. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s customers have seriously high expectations when it comes to support&#8212;54%
            have higher expectations now than they did a year ago; this skyrockets to 66% amongst GenZ and Millennial
            consumers.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;The Customer Experience industry&#8212;led by Alorica for over 20
            years&#8212;has helped companies rise to the occasion, introducing new, multichannel ways to empower
            customers and build strong brand engagement. But outsourcing is more than just moving operations elsewhere
            &#8211; offshore or otherwise. And the real risks aren&#8217;t necessarily costs and who provides support.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Successful outsourcing includes strategic assessments and business case development to find the
            best possible workforces--on-shore, near-shore, off-shore, WAH--to meet unique business goals. Download our

            started on the phones as an agent in 2003, but knew that I really wanted to be a trainer. I applied a few
            times, and when I finally got the opportunity, it was awesome! Then
            with some encouragement, I transitioned into operations&#8212;first as an Operations Manager&#8212;and have
            since been growing within the organization. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What&#8217;s an example of a choice you made that you are
            proud of or that served as a turning point in your career?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taking risks. Too often,
            we make &#8216;safe&#8217; decisions&#8212;but the times that I have taken
            risks and embraced opportunities outside of my comfort zone have turned out to be game changers! &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Could you offer any professional advice to employees who are
            just starting out?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just be you.&amp;nbsp;You are where you are for a reason, so step
            up and show up! Work hard and be a good example to others. Don&#8217;t hurt
            others along the way, be grateful and learn from the rough roads. And finally, change your attitude to &lt;i&gt;gratitude.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;What&#8217;s an example of a challenge you experienced at work? (Any due to being
            female?) How did you approach the problem and what were the results?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;Back in the day,
            the biggest challenge I faced was not
            having the appropriate tools and training for the job I wanted. My transition into a leadership role was
            tough. So, I went ahead and learned how I thought best. I made sure to sit next to a genius workforce
            person, so I could learn terminology, computations
            and how to optimize tools. I learned from leaders and my peers around me, and never stopped inquiring. I
            watched and I asked&#8212;and I still do that to this day. &amp;nbsp; I always look at everyone as my equal,
            no matter the title or experience. Today,
            when I present to organizations, I find very few women at the table&#8212;but I tell myself that my voice
            will stand out and be heard no matter what. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;Listen and share. The more we listen to one another, the more we learn&#8212;and vice versa. And
            Share what you know, because it makes your environment and
            support system stronger. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What is your favorite thing about working at Alorica, and
            what do you find most rewarding in your role?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;My favorite has got to be everyone I
            interact with&#8212;it&#8217;s such a family atmosphere! We&#8217;ve got the
            brightest, most creative and hardest-working people at Alorica&#8212;and that makes me want to strive to be
            better every day. The most rewarding part for me is seeing so many coworkers grow within the organization;
            we&#8217;ve all been a part of one
            another&#8217;s success in some shape or form, and we look out for each other. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Multichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use, it's
            become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that &lt;a
            title="99 percent of brands surveyed"
            href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"&gt;99 percent of brands surveyed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; were on Twitter, while
            another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account, Social Media Examiner said, citing
            Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go
            hand in hand.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are three principles to consider about social media customer service:
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Different channel, same service:&lt;/strong&gt; Just because there's a more
            relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided
            via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted, the end goal is to directly address any
            question, comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue, a brand may
            want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However, if a customer makes a
            lighthearted comment, then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective
            is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive
            channel.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;The quicker the response, the better:&lt;/strong&gt; The average response time for
            respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours, with 10 percent of businesses responding within the
            hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day, a
            timely response is best practice when it comes to real&#173;time communication. A Lithium Technologies study
            found that &lt;a title="53 percent of consumers"
            href="http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;53 percent of consumers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; expect a company
            to respond to their tweet within an hour, and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If
            brands neglect to respond, consumers take punishing actions. For example, 60 percent of respondents said
            they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;A social persona should be passive:&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to customer
            response, companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However, the overall
            personality of a business online should be informative and passive, if anything. There are going to be
            unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores, but that doesn't give it a free pass to
            negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging
            in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;hr&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOURCES&lt;/strong&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Security sure isn&#8217;t what it used to be! If the recent data breaches of high profile
            and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it&#8217;s
            that businesses need to seriously assess their data
            security. Now more than ever, utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft, with
            hackers taking advantage of lax security standards. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company,
            particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers&#8217;
            data is an essential component of providing top-notch
            customer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security, it&#8217;s
            important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to
            also identifying systems that can
            be used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting an outsourcing partner, here are three considerations your utility company
            should keep in mind:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI)
            compliant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to
            outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience),
            or you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; PCI compliant in-house, it&#8217;s critically important that
            your outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI
            compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification, but rather, tout &#8220;self-assessment&#8221;&#8212;which
            essentially means that they may not have
            been independently assessed, nor approved, by leading credit card providers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a
            potential outsourcing partner can offer:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the outsourcing partner PCI compliant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If
            yes, has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), or are they self-assessed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is
            the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being
            certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in
            infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCI Security Standard&#8217;s website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
            view their list of certified companies. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
            2013,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/frontline/2014/07/07/payment-card-data-isnt-the-only-lucrative-loot-in-a-data-breach/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45 percent of data thefts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;involved
            non-payment card
            data. Protecting your customers&#8217; payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the
            payment data can leave your customers&#8217; other personal data vulnerable. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember&#8212;it&#8217;s not just payment data at risk, so it&#8217;s important to ask
            your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during
            payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry
            like utilities, customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account
            number, phone number, address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If non-payment data is breached, it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012, nearly 2
            million customers of two&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/1986D5ECA1917A8A8525798E005F81DD/$File/pr12007.pdf?OpenElement"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York-based utility companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;had
            personal data such as their social security numbers, birthdates and other account information exposed. Since
            then, the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data&#8212;payment and
            non-payment&#8212;ask your outsourcing
            partner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout
            the customer journey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on
            their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures, but it&#8217;s also important
            to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. &amp;nbsp; Consider questions
            like these:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do your customers have the same experience with your payment processing
            partner as they do with your own representatives?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much control do you have
            over these interactions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is your partner committed to providing an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="/outcomes/actionable-insights/alorica-analytics" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;exceptional customer
            experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;every time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is
            your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS&lt;sup style="top: -0.3em; font-size:
            30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"&gt;&#174;&lt;/sup&gt; and customer satisfaction outcomes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now
            that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it&#8217;s more important than ever to take into
            consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study
            published in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;last
            year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still
            members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive
            experiences. You need to be certain you&#8217;re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions
            with your outsourcing partner! &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It&#8217;s
            about securing your customer&#8217;s data&#8212;all of it&#8212;and ensuring that every interaction with
            your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind
            when choosing your partner, you&#8217;ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that&#8217;s truly win-win.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company you work for matters; oftentimes we spend more time working with our
            colleagues than even seeing our friends and family. As I reflect on my last 20+ years working as a global
            Talent Acquisition leader, I've come to realize that the concept of an ideal workplace varies greatly from
            person to person. It hinges on factors like our personal goals, age, interests, location, financial
            situation and more. Job seekers&#8217; preferences can shift daily, but there's one constant thread that
            unites us. Regardless of our job title or experience level, we all seek out companies that foster a culture
            of support, growth and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's no one-size-fits-all way to tell if a
            company prioritizes its employees, there are a few qualities that all the best companies embody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;A
            Diverse Workforce&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any company can say DEI (Diversity, Equity &amp;amp;
            Inclusion) is important to them, but you want to look for employers that can give concrete examples of their
            commitment. Do they have diverse representation across their workforce? What about within their leadership
            team? There are many benefits to a strong DEI-focused culture; it allows employees to feel comfortable being
            themselves and confident to do their best work. According to the McKinsey report &lt;a
            href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delivering through Diversity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, diverse companies
            attract top talent and have better financial performance. At Alorica, a global CX provider, diversity is in
            our roots. We are the largest certified minority-owned BPO and as an example, 60% of our workforce is made
            up of women. In fact, we won an award for our Achievement in Promoting and Developing Women.&amp;nbsp; We
            are also proud to be awarded as a &lt;a
            href="https://www.alorica.com/news/detail/alorica-wins-top-place-to-work-for-its-dei-focused-culture-grassroots-philanthropy-and-employee-development-opportunities"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Top Place to Work by Ragan Awards&lt;/a&gt; for our DEI initiatives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healthy
            Work-Life Balance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're considering potential employers, work-life
            balance should be non-negotiable. Achieving a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
            has a significant impact on your mental and physical well-being. Research from &lt;a
            href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906876/full#:~:text=Previous%20research%20found%20that%20employee,performance%20in%20a%20medical%20context."
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Frontiers Media&lt;/a&gt; has shown that when there's a conflict between work and
            life, it can lead to lower productivity and performance, potentially holding back your career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
            Alorica, we offer a standard five-day work week and organize free health talk sessions as well as health
            checkup camps. Through our TIDE (Together for Inclusion Diversity and Equity) program, we create a safe and
            welcoming space for employees to openly and respectfully discuss social issues we face in our communities.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opportunities for Learning and Growth&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
            is nothing quite like a workplace that values your growth and development. Whether it is through training
            programs, new projects or helping another team, finding a company that believes in your potential and is
            ready to invest in it is key. It opens limitless possibilities in your career, making you more adaptable and
            versatile. As leaders, we can kickstart this process for future leaders. I take pride in being part of a
            company that invests in its employees at all levels, whether they are just starting or seasoned leaders. We
            get the chance to learn new skills through training programs led by experts from around the globe, which
            makes us more capable of tackling fresh challenges. Over 80% of our management roles last year were filled
            from internal promotions. That is the result of working for a company that cares about its people and their
            career journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now you know what to look for, but how do you know what a
            company&#8217;s work culture is really like? You can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dive
            into their website to see if their values, mission and activities resonate with you. Ask yourself, &#8216;is
            this a company (or leader) I&#8217;d be proud to work for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&#8217;t shy away from
            asking questions during the interview that help YOU decide if you want the job. We love candidates who are
            clear about their expectations and eager to learn more about our company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go check out
            the work environment. Can you imagine working there? Alorica offers walk-in interviews at our sites so that
            we can make the hiring process very efficient. We get to know our candidates in person and they get a sense
            of who we are too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content Moderation&#8212;the practice of screening, approving, or removing
            user-generated content based on pre-determined guidelines&#8212;is an essential component of the social
            media landscape. Over 4.74B people use social media platforms&#8212;including
            over 75% of the global population aged 13 and up&#8212;resulting in a worldwide daily average use of nearly
            2.5 hours&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with so many people online, creating safe spaces to transact
            and interact is becoming more challenging than ever before.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;A
            Seismic Shift Meets a Clear and Present Danger&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            world is online, using social media to share opinions and argue talking points in numbers never seen before;
            in the U.S. alone, a staggering 84% of 18-29 year olds are active social media users, with numbers only
            falling slightly to 81% for 30-49
            year olds&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,
            explicit content, misleading information, deepfake videos, and conspiracy theories are skyrocketing
            alongside an explosion in platform use. Such material erodes trust and confidence in our country&#8217;s
            (and indeed the world&#8217;s)
            most critical institutions&#8212;and puts individuals, brands and even established traditions at risk.
            &#8239;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do to counter a growing digital
            threat?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You deploy a combination of leading-edge
            technology and human oversight&#8212;and you select a partner who understands how to get the job done.&#8239;&#8239;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five
            Keys to Consider&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying successful content
            moderation is no small task&#8212;and it&#8217;s critical to get it right before bad actors can impact your
            brand reputation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five factors to keep
            in mind when selecting a partner: &#8239;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol
            style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed to Scale:&lt;/b&gt; Find a partner who can easily
            support your needs&#8212;especially when they&#8217;re urgently needed. Your ideal partner should be able to
            support rapid ramps worldwide, handle high volumes of published content, and have
            a legacy of ramping programs swiftly and successfully.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trust
            &amp;amp; Safety Expertise: &lt;/b&gt;Experience matters&#8212;especially with content moderation. And that
            takes a combination of top-tier talent plus safety protocols and regulatory know-how to keep both clients
            and frontline moderators secure;
            the best partners have both.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance:&lt;/b&gt; A great partner has a proven track record plus a
            platform that harnesses automation technology, AI, and deep analytics to make easy work of moderating
            multi-media content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talent &amp;amp; Training: &lt;/b&gt;Top-tier talent doesn&#8217;t just happen&#8230;a
            trust-worthy partner hires, trains, coaches, and fortifies their frontline content moderators, ensuring
            consistency and scalability in any region. A solid partner
            continually optimizes the capabilities of its workforce to consistently deliver through ongoing training,
            from expanding existing skillsets to keeping up with policy changes.&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wellness:&lt;/b&gt; Best-practice based wellness policies are essential for
            content moderation success&#8212;partners should care for their people by offering global wellness and
            resiliency programs led by licensed mental health practitioners. Daily
            monitoring of employee wellness, mood, and satisfaction also helps ensure that your first line of defense is
            always up for the task.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b
            style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: var(--color-h5); font-size: var(--font-size-h5);
            text-align: inherit; word-spacing: normal; white-space: inherit"&gt;We&#8217;re In This Together&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While
            the world is more connected than ever, our interlocked societies struggle with bad actors who sully digital
            platforms with vitriol, manipulation, and lies. Major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have
            recently stepped-up activities
            to curtail the spread of misleading information, but free-speech arguments are quick to emerge&#8212;and the
            moderation landscape is evolving daily. &#8239;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like it
            or not,&#8239;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;social media&#8239;has become&#8239;the media&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#8212;and
            though journalists possess credentials and routinely fact-check their work product, everyday citizens do
            not. So, it&#8217;s imperative that we prioritize moderation efforts
            and empower our people to safeguard online interests. &#8239;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
            the end of the day, the content is here&#8212;and moderation is there to meet it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;font

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Financial Solutions Strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trouble on the Horizon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s
            no getting around it&#8212;a financial slump is coming. Political and economic worries are going up, and the
            market is revealing increased debt loads and significant upticks in auto, credit card and consumer credit
            delinquencies. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than ever, there are demands to increase profits. Lofty consumer experience
            expectations are on the rise and we are facing accelerating requests to right-size business in response to
            rapidly shifting markets. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s pressure-driven economy, now is the
            time for businesses to adapt. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s time to get efficient. To get nimble.
            To get paid. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s time to talk to Alorica. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consider the Following&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being proactive during tight financial times
            is paramount. It&#8217;s simple&#8212;when your customers are ready to pay their bills, you have to be ready
            to receive payment. Lining up the right approach now will keep you ahead of the curve and reduce
            losses down the line. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the markets head south, think about these
            questions: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#a55416"&gt;1. Do you currently have capacity?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When
            delinquencies rise, getting paid first matters more than ever. Bolster your customer support teams to
            prepare for an up-tick in
            volume. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#a55416"&gt;2. Do you have an external partner? And do they have
            the ability to add coverage during a downturn?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Your internal teams can only
            handle so much. When the needs increase, be ready to deliver 24/7
            service with an experienced partner. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#a55416"&gt;3. If you have a current external partner, are they
            &#8216;at the ready&#8217;&#8212;and able to ramp within three months?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The
            ability to get up to speed quickly makes all the difference. A fast
            ramp means serving your customers sooner. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#a55416"&gt;4.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deciding to make the move to automation is one thing. Knowing where to start is another.
            No doubt you&#8217;ve done your homework&#8212;read the latest blogs and eBooks like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;5 Ways to Drive Calls Out of Your Call Center&lt;/a&gt;&#8212; yet you still can&#8217;t
            quite figure out how to get started. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service.&amp;nbsp;
            Remember, automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for
            building a strategic framework, you&#8217;ll be able to distinguish
            the simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework
            is as simple as two steps. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Dial in on Demographics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider
            the demographic of your caller&#8212;and your industry. A &lt;strong&gt;West Interactive Services CX Marks
            the Spot&lt;/strong&gt; study found that customers&#8217; likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service
            depends on the service provided.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the Government Services/Healthcare sector, for example. While there is a larger
            appetite for interactive channels including online chat, self-help, etc., fewer customers are open to a
            mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast, in the Automotive
            sector, the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater, with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted
            channels. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to age, non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a
            traditional service channel&#8212;phone, email, in-person, chat or self-help&#8211;whereas a Millennial is 5
            to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media
            platform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for
            self-service automation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch your self-service engagement strategy early on, leveraging your customers&#8217;
            profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how, when and where to market and engage customers on the
            available self-service channel options. After all, you
            want to bring the greatest value&#8211;targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Revisit Customer Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take
            a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling
            and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example &#8211; are they calling
            for password resets, package
            tracking, balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer
            inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving, then it is more
            suitable for automation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are
            the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is
            there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense
            of resolution? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While originally designed for repeat contact reduction, the same steps work for all
            contacts. Identify contact reasons, develop solutions, check in to see that the plan is working and act to
            achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice
            to take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing conclusions from the data you already have positions you for a meaningful
            conversation about where to go with the automation of your business processes. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still need help? Consider consulting a professional Customer Experience Transformation
            and Analytics Team. &amp;nbsp;For information about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;how

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although it&#8217;s hard to believe, millennials make up most of today&#8217;s contact
            center middle management. But disheartening trends indicate that most don&#8217;t intend to remain at their

            &lt;p&gt;There are proven best practices to help retain middle management and cultivate new leaders. Hiring

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;THE CLIENT&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This client, a leading provider of Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services, sought to continue
            providing their customers with exceptional support during seasonal times of high customer enrollment.
            Alorica was called upon to create a flexible, burstable
            staffing model to ensure that they were always meeting their customer&#8217;s needs, as well as providing
            information on new customer opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE PROGRAM&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The client was receiving a high amount of calls during their annual enrollment cycles. Unlike
            traditional mail services, the client&#8217;s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries
            regarding high-end medications, while also providing those
            customers new services for consideration. Consequently, the program needed agents trained in both inbound
            customer care and sales. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As they say in Gotham, when the Commissioner calls, you pick up. And we do. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client&#8217;s
            significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s right. We doubled our workforce. That&#8217;s just the kind of thing we do for our
            clients. But we digress. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensity-to-contact members,
            ultimately reducing the client&#8217;s overall cost per prescription. Furthermore, we implemented a
            proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations,
            and created welcome calls as part of a member&#8217;s engagement strategy. To do so, we analyzed landline
            leads, conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the
            best time of day and day of week
            in which to contact them. Finally, we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively
            used alternative, low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Top performer for increasing prescription conversions, per contact, by 10-15%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Consistently a top performer among all of the client&#8217;s internal contact centers&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Since implementing Alorica&#8217;s custom program, the client has experienced a 6% increase on
            member scores and a 19% increase on provider scores&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in
            the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually
            (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found
            that employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study
            include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%).
            These facts are not portraying a pretty
            picture for the men and women in our organizations. It&#8217;s clear that more and more people are getting
            burnout in the workplace and it&#8217;s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce
            this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017). &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various
            industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing
            channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer
            service representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from
            2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR
            employment is growing faster than
            the national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors
            leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014). &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Exactly is Employee Burnout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving
            52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn&#8217;t doing enough to prevent burnout
            (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as
            &#8220;a syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do
            &#8216;people work&#8217; of some kind&#8221; (Jackson, 1981). &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume
            of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study
            (Toister, 2016), agents &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to deliver excellent
            service in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to
            accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to
            their needs and its customers.
            Agents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are Those Burnout Symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a
            customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests
            daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from
            their work. It&#8217;s an uphill
            battle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center
            environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first
            year of employment (Jackson, 1981):
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Emotional Exhaustion:&lt;/strong&gt; Agents feel that
            as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological
            level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cynicism Towards Customers:&lt;/strong&gt; Agents are prone to
            negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions
            to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional
            Efficacy: &lt;/strong&gt;&#8220;The tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one&#8217;s
            work with customers.&#8221; In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the
            consequences can
            be quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions
            to Prevent Agent Burnout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, burnout symptoms occur in
            organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it
            comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy.
            To prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Avoid Favoritism&lt;/strong&gt;: Treat people
            with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one
            person or group against another, will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="padding-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Have Clear Values&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure that operational
            processes and the company&#8217;s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees
            perceive a value conflict on the job, their engagement with work tends to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="padding-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: &lt;/strong&gt;Establish
            continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in
            decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact
            center environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Understand the Contact
            Center Environment: &lt;/strong&gt;Training or seminars can enhance the employee&#8217;s capacity to cope
            with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead, the
            organization
            should start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is
            commonplace, and no one is immune to it. It&#8217;s important to structure your work environment so that
            every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed. At Alorica,
            we&#8217;re focused
            on creating insanely great customer interactions. It starts with providing a healthy work environment for
            our people, filled with a culture rooted in fun, encouragement and collaboration. With Millennials poised to
            make up 75% of the workforce
            by 2025, building a positive corporate culture to attract and retain the talent-rich Generation Y will help
            you stay ahead of the competition. No need for a decoder ring. Here are &lt;a

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trust &amp;amp; Safety Professional Organization (TSPA) is a global community of Trust
            &amp;amp; Safety professionals who develop and enforce principles, policies, and practices to create online
            standards of behavior and content facilitated by digital technologies. The association is overseen by
            venerated tech pioneers, legal experts, and professors, including former COOs of Mozilla and Heads of Policy
            from Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPSA offers a comprehensive overview into Trust
            &amp;amp; Safety, both as an industry and as a practice, including &lt;a
            href="https://www.tspa.org/curriculum/ts-fundamentals/industry-overview/future-of-ts/"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Future of Trust &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;a
            review of new challenges presented by the continued evolution of technology and the pervasive nature of
            threats online. In the market overview, the TSPA defines several key areas of focus; as a leading Trust
            &amp;amp; Safety provider for ~15 years, our perspective offers a seasoned view on these trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Increased
            investments to keep users safe&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed by the TPSA, companies have been investing
            more in Trust &amp;amp; Safety, particularly over the past decade. Industries from nearly every niche are
            prioritizing online safety, from beefing up security to harnessing AI/NLP technology to streamline
            multi-media moderation efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For online platforms and eCommerce websites, keeping
            users safe is a top priority&#8212;safeguarding against bad actors, fraud, and malicious content is
            essential to bottom lines&#8212;requiring constant oversight and action in an ever-changing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping
            ahead of the curve is essential for successful content moderation, as well as anticipating client needs.
            Investing heavily in leading-edge technology and top-tier talent, partnering with third-party technology
            developers, and working with diverse, global Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams gives companies an advantage
            against online threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we couldn&#8217;t agree more; our many investments include
            implementing proprietary and third-party tools to streamline multilingual, multi-media content moderation,
            speed up collaboration and information flow, and enhance training, coaching, and retention. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But,
            in our experience, we&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s just as important to take care of your frontline
            content moderators, those intrepid individuals staring down online threats day after day. Caring for our
            people is a bedrock principle at Alorica; digital, gamified apps and to assess engagement and mood, ongoing
            wellness coaching and training, as well as anytime access to licensed mental health professionals, keep our
            content moderators going strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Proactive
            and protective efforts&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bad actors and cybercriminals become increasingly
            sophisticated, cybersecurity strategies continually evolve to meet new threats. A highlight of the TPSA
            report is the importance of keeping customers and clients safe online; this requires a deep understanding of
            the different ways users can be harmed, as well as how they act with online platforms.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful
            Trust &amp;amp; Safety efforts adapt to policy changes, keeping both clients and content moderators
            up-to-date about what threats are out there&#8212;and what can be done about them. We&#8217;ve found deep
            analytics to be absolutely invaluable for illuminating user behavior, as well as isolating known threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To
            best support the needs and requirements of leading global brands, Alorica&#8217;s approach relies on a
            combination of data-driven analytics, a nimble and scalable worldwide workforce, proprietary technology, and
            training models to ensure content moderation is always accurate, expedient, and based on intent, local
            context, current events, and community guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Keeping
            in lockstep with new legislation and regulations&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s online has been influencing
            everything from public policy to fashion trends for over a quarter century, and how people communicate in
            online spaces has become increasingly important to everyone from governments, corporations, and
            organizations to individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the TPSA advises, free expression is vital to online
            communities, but companies and countries often have to grapple with what&#8217;s said and spread online
            without existing guidelines, creating new policies quickly because users expect the platforms they use to be
            safe and secure at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, we&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s essential to
            keep up with corporate policies and regulatory changes, and continually educate all Trust &amp;amp; Safety
            specialists, including content moderators, as well as proactively prepare for changing requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Ready

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The client&#8212;a security software company&#8212;required a very specific agent profile
            to provide world-class technical support to their highly-knowledgeable customer base.&amp;nbsp;After a
            complete assessment, we concluded that our proprietary hiring
            analytics platform would play a key role in sourcing the right talent for this nearshore operation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Download our&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;We've Got Their Back (Up's)! A Hiring Analytics Case Study&amp;nbsp;to
            learn more. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Launch a nearshore operation&#8212;close to the client&#8217;s home-base, and with agents who
            possess strong English-speaking skills&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Identify, train and deploy a team of qualified agents to handle chat and email channels&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate success in the first wave, and prepare for a larger deployment&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Using hiring analytics and advanced agent profiling, &lt;strong&gt;100% of chat/email applicants&lt;/strong&gt;
            that were hired graduated training and passed rigorous client clearance QA processes with flying colors&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;CSAT scores jumped by &lt;strong&gt;73%;&lt;/strong&gt; performing &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;
            higher vs. client&#8217;s in-house team&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;We anticipate &lt;strong&gt;150% growth&lt;/strong&gt; with the client&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Starting Small and Thinking Big.&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Handling chat and email channels can be more complicated than voice-based technical support work,
            so finding a team of qualified agents presented as a unique test. The client discovered this first-hand, as
            their existing team couldn&#8217;t run concurrent
            chats and made missteps&#8212;and simply didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to support everything at once.
            Shortly after launching our program, we successfully migrated the first wave of voice-support agents over to
            chat and email&#8212;and buoyed by
            their success, prepared to expand.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Multitasking to the Rescue!&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our agents in this program are in a totally different kind of position; they not only need to be
            proficient in tech support but have to be able to toggle between multiple conversations at once. Our
            proprietary hiring analytics platform played a key role
            in sourcing the right talent; this technology allowed us to construct the ideal agent profile, and we used
            the platform to screen candidates for their multitasking abilities, ultimately hiring agents best suited for
            the complex, multi-channel work.
            The new, Jamaica-based team quickly exceeded expectations in both customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall
            Quality Assurance (QA). Coupled with cutting down Average Handle Time (AHT) and the cost savings this
            nearshore location offered, the client
            was thrilled
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Ever-expanding Opportunities.&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the success of the program, we continue to absorb more volume from the client, and we are
            currently exploring ways to expand lines of business. We began with just a few agents in this multi-channel
            support role, and we&#8217;re on pace to more
            than quadruple the number of agents by the end of 2019. We estimate that that once the team is fully up to
            speed, we&#8217;ll average up to two concurrent chats at all times&#8212;and we&#8217;re pretty darn proud
            of that&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h5&gt;UNPRECEDENTED TIMEFRAMES. UNREAL CIRCUMSTANCES. UNMATCHED RESULTS.&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck,
            and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual
            model, this wasn&#8217;t our first WAH rodeo.
            Far from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for
            the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously
            valuable, as we worked to migrate the
            client&#8217;s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment&#8212;in only a few weeks.
            The outcome was transformative&#8212;and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we&#8217;ll
            get to all that. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/h5&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Attrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&amp;amp;M) agents in the
            same program&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Customers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&amp;amp;M employees&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;AHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&amp;amp;M&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Contact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h5&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience when it mattered most.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program&#8212;including
            working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance
            Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that
            agents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding,
            training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a
            work-at-home customer experience outsourcing
            model, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent
            group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home.
            Still, moving that many agents in
            such a short timeframe&#8212;and against the backdrop of COVID-19&#8212;was no small order
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;THE SOLUTION&lt;/h5&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best practices for a best-in-class result. &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Time was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home
            workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Existing best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents, and as they adjusted to
            their new at-home environment, we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both
            agents and leadership. These routines were grounded
            in a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards, two-way virtual agent
            communication, collaboration and top-notch leadership support&#8212;and were a vital component of previous
            and ongoing success.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/h5&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging the past and looking to the future. &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several months into the new normal, the client&#8217;s work-at-home teams consistently outperform
            their legacy B&amp;amp;M counterparts in key metrics. Today, as regulations slowly allow
            employees to return on-site, a hub-and-spoke model is being used; agents are acquiring skills in a B&amp;amp;M
            environment, before &#8216;graduating&#8217; to WAH when and if circumstances dictate In fact, our success
            with the program has earned us a
            best-in-class reputation&#8212;against which now benchmark agent performance. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s an unpredictable world out there&#8212;and preparedness and confidence in a solution
            goes a long way.
            &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A streamlined troubleshooting guide can help effectively resolve a customer issue and
            improve the overall customer experience. Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service
            environment or through an interactive voice response system
            (IVR). It&#8217;s a critical component of self-service, designed to empower the customer through the
            resolution process. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a time of information overload, it&#8217;s important to keep information accessible, current and
            accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to
            Salesforce, 75% of consumers say that say it is important
            to be able to interact with a company on &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;personal schedule.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Follow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution
            and increases overall satisfaction. After all, the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making
            it easy for them to do business with you.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As you build your customer knowledgebase, the first step is identifying possible scenarios or
            problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some examples include:
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Setting up an account&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Resetting a password&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Accessing an account&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Reinstating service&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Adding services to the account&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs).&amp;nbsp; HAPs help you to
            identify where the customer is when the need for help arises.&amp;nbsp; Your strategy for how to design and
            deliver customer facing service content would be impacted
            by the HAPs identified.&amp;nbsp; A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content
            to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are
            recommending that specific brand.&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;As you think through potential reasons a
            customer would need support, keep in mind the customer lifecycle
            of your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the Self-Service Content&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now that you&#8217;ve compiled the list of potential customer issues, it&#8217;s time to roll up
            your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential
            customer issues. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree
            and a process map.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;A decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on
            what occurs at each step.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;A process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an
            issue.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps, it&#8217;s important that you think
            about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For
            example, when you are guiding a customer through self-help,
            it&#8217;s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the
            steps for resolution. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly.&amp;nbsp;
            Resolving a customer&#8217;s issue through self-service doesn&#8217;t need to be complex.&amp;nbsp; In a
            recent article, Gartner states that organizations often have
            very complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your
            customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and
            knowledge are key attributes of leading
            enterprises.
            &lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developing content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for
            both self-service and contact center support, the less content management you will need post-deployment.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand How Often Your Content is Being Used&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In any business, measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have
            opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase.&amp;nbsp; To measure the
            effectiveness of your content, you need to understand
            how often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer&#8217;s issue.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;In a self-service environment, you can include a question&#8212;&lt;em&gt;Did this information
            resolve your issue?&lt;/em&gt; &#8212;after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;In a contact center environment, the agent can ask the question, or you can collect the data
            through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer&#8217;s issue, it&#8217;s
            also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for
            searches. This insight will help you optimize
            your search functionality and your content management strategy. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Your Self-Service Content&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place
            to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately, it increases the effort required by your
            customers as they search through large quantities
            of content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt
            an unnecessary increase in call volumes. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even further, too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains
            accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand.&amp;nbsp;
            Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand
            because of the ability to easily find the information or help they need.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center, but content
            management will ultimately drive your success. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To be successful at content management, define a process to update your knowledgebase.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Establish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Maintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Update the key search words based on current content available.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Remove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites
            replace the original articles.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to
            resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their
            own issues in a way that&#8217;s fast and easy. A study
            by Ganter predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever
            needing to interact with another person.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In this DIY era, offering self-service is a necessity. It shows you are listening and understand
            the way your customers want to be served. Meanwhile, it deflects unnecessary call volumes thereby reducing
            your overall cost per transaction. Using an effective
            knowledgebase content plan to deliver an effortless self-service experience compliments customer support and
            provides the customer multiple ways to resolve their issue. When done effectively, this drives improvement
            in the overall customer experience
            and improves how customers feel about your brand. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;b&gt;Karly Jandoc&lt;/b&gt;, Alorica&#8217;s Sr. Director, Talent Acquisition, was in college, she knew
            one thing for sure about her career goals. She wanted to work with people because building relationships was
            her passion. So, it&#8217;s no surprise
            that a job in recruiting was her next step. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a background in temporary
            staffing, employment management in the hotel industry, and corporate recruiting, her role at Alorica has
            allowed her to meld her two strengths together: managing teams and matching individuals with the right job
            opportunities.
            She has found success by truly believing in what she&#8217;s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle
            courses that you can overcome. Read Karly&#8217;s full Q&amp;amp;A below: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What gets you up in the morning?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; Knowing that I have a direct impact on really pleasing our
            customers and our clients and growing Alorica. Every day we have hundreds of
            agents starting in our organization. I love doing what I do because I know I am making a difference, and I
            add the human touch into it. When I am visiting sites and I see the family feel and see people connecting to
            others, I love knowing that people
            are making long-lasting relationships at work. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What are the key ways that you approach challenges in your
            day to day work?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/font&gt; I&#8217;m a visual type
            of person. What I tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice
            is, &#8220;okay, list the obstacles, and now let&#8217;s talk about how we will go about removing those
            obstacles.&#8221; Then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle. After you&#8217;ve gotten
            through your obstacle course, it&#8217;s
            helpful to go back and, in your mind, list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and
            fixed them. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: How do you view mentorship in the workplace?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/font&gt; I advanced in my career because mentors set great examples. In
            my first job out of college, I absorbed everything like a sponge.
            Whether they knew it or not, there were people who I looked at for inspiration. Their actions helped me
            learn and grow. Today, I find mentors everywhere--they are the people that leave me thinking after a phone
            call. They get my mind turning, help
            me understand challenges, and get me thinking about how I can take control of what I can control. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What motivated you in pursuing this career path?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt;
            I wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people. In recruiting, you&#8217;re
            always giving
            good news. &#8220;You got a job! Congratulations!&#8221; If I can go to bed at night thinking to myself,
            &#8220;Today, I placed 30 people in positions, I know they&#8217;re excited and I&#8217;m excited.&#8221;
            That was my drive for choosing my own
            job roles throughout my career. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: Did you have a
            specific career plan that led to your current role at Alorica?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt;
            For me, it hasn&#8217;t necessarily been about making a long-term career plan. An opportunity
            came up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a Sr. Director of Talent
            Acquisition. It helped get me back into managing people, an area in which I am also passionate about. Having
            been with Alorica for almost six years,
            I love making an impact on the organization in both areas.&lt;/p&gt;

            customers to tell others about their experience. However, 90% of customers are satisfied after an
            interaction that took less time or effort to resolve than expected.

            unveiling of our own global Women&#8217;s Initiative. The creation of the Women&#8217;s Initiative has been
            a passion project in the making, and was developed as a
            forum to bring together the entire Alorica community &#8211; both women and men &#8211; to enhance the
            company&#8217;s culture of possibilities for its current and future leaders. &amp;nbsp;

            Communications. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;h5&gt;Sometimes, the Bot Knows Best&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
            and Robotic Desktop Automation (RDA), it&#8217;s not just about what the technology can do&#8212;it&#8217;s
            about what the technology enables our people to do. Thanks to these platforms, agents solve issues faster,
            performance variability decreases, and customer experience is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let&#8217;s
            take a look at just a few examples of Intelligent Automation in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            you ever asked a leader, &#8220;Any advice for someone who aspires to be in your position?&#8221; Chances
            are, you&#8217;ve probably gotten different replies each time&#8212;which just goes to show, there&#8217;s
            no one way to the top! Illustrating
            this point beautifully is this month&#8217;s Alorican in Action, VP of Client Solutions, &lt;b&gt;Beverley
            Bridges&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read Beverley&#8217;s Q&amp;amp;A below to explore her unique 13-year
            career at Alorica (and counting), and advice for succeeding on your own path.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: Did you have a plan to reach an executive-level position?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; I&#8217;d like to say that I strategically orchestrated my
            career every step of the way, but that would be a lie.
            Being successful has meant always doing my best, recognizing that I am responsible for the choices that I
            make, and treating people how I want them to treat me. I believe that diversity is what makes us great, so I
            like to bring my perspective to
            situations and encourage others to do so as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: Did you ever work with a mentor, and did that process help
            you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; I have a lot of mentors&#8212;and
            most of them don&#8217;t even know I see them that way! My philosophy
            is that the &lt;i&gt;life you live speaks louder than the words you say&lt;/i&gt;. Mentors have been both
            colleagues and people I know outside of work&#8212;almost everyone has taught me something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What advice would you give about climbing the career ladder?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; Know your value. If you don&#8217;t know it, nobody else will.
            Also, lift others as you climb and don&#8217;t
            give up or give in if your career track isn&#8217;t going as you imagined&#8212;resiliency is a great skill
            to master. Lastly, don&#8217;t burn bridges. You never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague
            for advice or a fresh point of
            view.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; My grandmother and mother always said, &#8220;get in where you
            fit in.&#8221; Through my regular one-on-one meetings
            with each of my clients, I try to find commonalities; it doesn&#8217;t have to be about work, but perhaps
            family, hobbies, upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us. Connecting with people is how you
            build trust and respect.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Q: What excites you most about what you do? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/font&gt; Taking on new challenges. The hurdles are exciting, and once
            you get to the other side of it, you can say, &#8220;this is what
            we did.&#8221; What also brings me joy is keeping people motivated. I think it&#8217;s very important as
            women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward. Surround yourself
            with people who share your goals and
            objectives, and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track. You may not
            always like what they have to say, but as women, authentic relationships are critical.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so incredibly proud of the culture we&#8217;ve built&#8212;and continue to grow&#8212;at
            Alorica. From office celebrations to company-wide contests and recognition, taking care of our people is our
            #1 priority&#8212;and we work tirelessly to keep
            our teams engaged, inspired and connected. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It all starts with our four Core Values: &lt;strong&gt;Be Connected, Be Bold, Be Relentless &lt;/strong&gt;and
            &lt;strong&gt;Be True&lt;/strong&gt;. These tenets empower every Alorica employee, and describe how we do
            what&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;we do. As a company, everything we
            prioritize and stand for&#8212;including the way we recognize each other&#8217;s accomplishments, train new
            staff and measure success&#8212;closely aligns with each Value. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;And by adhering to our Values, we can more effectively deliver on our Brand Promise: &lt;strong&gt;Passion.
            Performance. Possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;This is the pledge we make each and every day to our
            clients and their customers&#8212;and
            it&#8217;s what fuels our
            vision of making lives better&#8230;one interaction at a time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/default-source/insights/alorica_csr.png?sfvrsn=6658460e_0" height="250"
            class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56818" width="250"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our world-class culture is grounded in charitable giving, engaging social impact and environmental
            sustainability initiatives. Aloricans want more than a job&#8212;they want a purpose&#8212;and as Chief
            Culture Officer, I&#8217;m honored to partner
            with leaders across the organization and provide opportunities to such an amazing and conscientious
            workforce. Every culture/employee experience program we&#8217;ve developed allows our people to explore and
            grow, and enables them to connect with
            not only the company, but each other. Some of these programs include: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture Champions &amp;amp; Committees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Every Alorica site has its own Culture Committee&#8212;led by a Culture Champion&#8212;whose
            members plan on-site events and help oversee company-wide celebrations and contests. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Lives Better With Alorica(MLBA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other. With 80 MLBA chapters around the world,
            employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and
            volunteering. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing, and taking care of one another, is an integral part of who we are. Alorica
            was built on three P&#8217;s&#8212;Passion, Performance and Possibilities. But when it comes to CSR, we
            focus on another three: Philanthropy, People and
            Planet. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Changer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We make it a point to recognize when our people go above and beyond. Our Game Changer&lt;em&gt;
            &lt;/em&gt;program is held company-wide, and celebrates and rewards top performers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&#8217;s Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our Women&#8217;s Initiative champions amazing female Aloricans around the globe. This program
            provides a platform in which our Alorica community comes together to connect, support and develop our
            current and future leaders. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloricans In Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aloricans in Action gives us the opportunity to highlight outstanding members of our team, and
            celebrate the efforts of a global workforce that performs with passion and embraces all kinds of
            possibilities. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alorica Academy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Alorica Academy is a comprehensive global leadership development platform that allows our
            people to learn, contribute, share and grow professionally. It offers clear visibility into career
            development opportunities, and helps leadership identify who
            is ready for the next level&#8212;ensuring we maintain a strong, sustainable bench of talent. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloricares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a privilege to give back to those who have given so much. We&#8217;re pleased to provide
            career opportunities for returning U.S. veterans and active-duty spouses. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our passion for leading has allowed us to craft a world-class corporate
            culture&#8212;one that plays a critical role in identifying attrition risks and developing talent. This
            company is only as strong as the people behind it, and the incredible dedication of our 100,000+ employees
            inspires me to make Alorica an utterly
            awesome, insanely great&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;place to work&#8212;day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

            Pency Smith says she can sometimes seem intimidating, especially when she&#8217;s thinking. Armed with a
            master&#8217;s degree in philosophy, this Director of Client Solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the
            root causes of an issue and
            to help guide her to a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pency started out as an agent and has since held
            positions in quality, training and operations management. She believes change can be scary, but it&#8217;s
            also good. Read her full Q&amp;amp;A below.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What professional advice has helped you in your career?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;Early on, I was trying to fit into the mold of what I thought a young, strong black woman in
            corporate America was supposed to be like. I have a really big
            personality, I&#8217;m very opinionated and I can come off a little harsh sometimes, but I was silencing
            myself. Then Colleen Beers gave me the best advice: she said to &#8220;be Pency.&#8221; That really freed me
            up to come into my own.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;Looking back, do you regret any career moves you did or didn&#8217;t
            make?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once Andy Lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve, but I
            didn&#8217;t speak up because I didn&#8217;t want to come
            off as a know-it-all or be a troublemaker. I wasn&#8217;t being Pency! I really regret not using my voice
            when I had the opportunity, but I don&#8217;t hold back anymore.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;How can we all continue to better ourselves at work?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;Our success is dependent upon each other, so see what you can do to improve. Take every class and
            attend every conference that&#8217;s offered to you. Last
            year I attended COPC certification training, and it was my most eye-opening experience ever, both personally
            and professionally.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What does it take to build lasting relationships with
            colleagues, clients and other contacts?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;A lot of people have difficulty delivering
            bad news, especially to clients, but my main thing is honest communication.
            I won&#8217;t sugarcoat it, I&#8217;ll just say it. And if it can be fixed, they know that I&#8217;ll roll
            up my sleeves and dig in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What is your advice on how to make
            meaningful connections?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;Be honest. Let your personality come through, and don&#8217;t
            be afraid to be vulnerable. A meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone,
            and they&#8217;re who they are to you. It&#8217;s the only way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting great CX is a process. And it starts with a single step called customer experience
            journey mapping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey mapping process examines where a company is&#8212;e.g., the
            current state&#8212;to design their ideal CX, providing visualizations of each touchpoint customers
            experience, including digital and traditional interactions. Alorica&#8217;s journey mapping process uses a
            voice-centered approach that always puts the voice of the customer front and center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download
            the fact sheet to learn how customer experience journey mapping transforms customer journeys into successful
            outcomes&#8212;boosting acquisition, retention and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s on the horizon for marketers this year? To find out, I sought insight from
            the following nine tech executives . &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;
            Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Standard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally
            focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an
            individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches
            to handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine
            learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround
            events and the role they play in
            that funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead
            move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active
            and showing commercial intent.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of digital fluency, marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we&#8217;d
            be going into 2021. Alicia Tillman, Global Chief Marketing Officer at SAP &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The technology, the tactics, the flexible mindset &#8211; with these tools,
            disruption is no longer the showstopper it once was. As the world moves forward day by day, marketers are
            more prepared than ever to be agile and deliver the experiences
            audiences need, when they need them. Rather than months-long marketing campaigns, brand marketing will more
            closely mirror the way we&#8217;re living our lives as individuals. In the moment, deeply empathetic, and
            tuned into each other&#8217;s needs.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will see a stark divide in an organization&#8217;s marketing budget
            spend, followed by consequential impact.&lt;/strong&gt; Jim Kruger, Chief Marketing Officer, Veeam &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year, there will be a
            resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end, companies will look to cut back on marketing
            budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be
            managed up or down fairly easily. On the other end, companies will increase investment in marketing because
            they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead, those organizations
            pivoting funds away from marketing will
            ultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on, and by toggling budgets
            up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies
            well behind others who continue
            to invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more
            successful in the long run.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. &lt;/strong&gt;Dan
            Lowden, Chief Marketing Officer, White Ops
            &lt;br&gt;&#8220;In 2021, marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans
            as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing
            spend. Marketers will partner with specialists
            that can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans &#8211; resulting in better
            customer experience, ensuring higher engagement, bringing visibility to cleaner data, improving the
            company's compliance position and driving
            stronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table
            because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is
            effectively spent.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise
            their walls even higher.&lt;/strong&gt;Abhay Singhal, CEO, InMobi Marketing Cloud &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an extremely uncertain period of time, and CMOs shouldn&#8217;t have one
            roadmap &#8211; they should have multiple. For starters, marketing teams will need to be prepared to make
            the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing
            within the app. On the flip side, marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that
            data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as
            possible. Without this, advertisers are
            at risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over, which compromises brand image and user
            experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical, and marketers need to start
            setting expectations and redefining metrics
            as soon as possible.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing
            talent.&lt;/strong&gt; Amanda Bohne, Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that so many companies have proven that, for many, remote work can be as
            effective as in-office work, it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if
            they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will
            now be sought after by companies located across the country, enabling them to potentially live somewhere
            different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company
            where in-office work is mandated will
            start to meaningfully impact your candidate pool, and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.&#8221;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter what product you sell, what you need to market is trust. &lt;/strong&gt;Dale
            Renner CEO, Co-Founder, RedPoint Global &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers want trust in the product quality, trust in the organization handling
            your data, trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs, trust
            that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately
            driven through a series of interactions &#8211; those brands that are responsible with a consumer&#8217;s
            data and use it to create value for the consumer, those that provide consistent experiences, those that
            operate at the consumer&#8217;s cadence
            will build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy, will experience a dramatic decline in customer
            loyalty and brand value.&#8239;&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with
            existing customers.&lt;/strong&gt; Elena Filimonova, SVP, Marketing CGS &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits
            of their service, while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and
            tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers,
            Marketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the
            current environment.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and
            data privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Susan Lee, Chief Product Officer, Valassis &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the new year, it&#8217;s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put
            similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile
            device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on
            a one-to-one or known basis. Instead, marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models
            and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base,
            maximizing scale.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty.&lt;/strong&gt;
            Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer, &lt;a href="https://alorica.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Alorica
            Inc.&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In today&#8217;s 'continuously-connected' way of life, it&#8217;s not enough that
            brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX&#8212;being able to
            alternate quickly from different platforms, but for these channels to also be personalized, persistent and
            effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021, you&#8217;ll
            see more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers&#8217; wants through advanced
            analytics and embedded intelligence, which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that
            allow brands to market, sell and serve
            their customers better and faster. When brands proactively &#8216;push&#8217; tailored experiences rather
            than rely on customers to &#8216;pull&#8217; from services after they&#8217;ve had a problem, that changes
            the nature of the relationship, offering
            insights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of
            always-connected consumers, new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights,
            context and channels that ultimately redefine
            brand loyalty.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A common topic of conversation in the customer experience world is the ideal customer
            satisfaction survey. How many questions should it include? What are the right channels? How do you increase
            survey return rates? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While these questions make sense, are they the right questions to ask? Rather than trying to find
            the perfect survey (minimal questions with insightful answers, and a high rate of return), companies should
            consider asking a different question&#8212;is
            the current method for delivering surveys generating the data needed to improve the business, as well as the
            overall customer experience? &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A better use of time and resources is to reevaluate the strategy used to gather sentiment. Use
            these 6 tips as a starting point to help ensure that you continually receive useful data from the consumers
            that best represent your customer base.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ask the right people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The people answering your surveys are likely not the best representatives of your customer base.
            According to Gartner, the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and
            very upset. This creates a data set that
            omits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the
            majority of the company&#8217;s customers.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses
            crave, it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate, which
            leads to our next point. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep customers from saying, &#8216;No way, survey!&#8217;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Surveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your
            user quitting the survey part way through, and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Businesses who are focusing on
            how to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to
            communicate, and tailor the channels utilized accordingly. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ask the right questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction
            questions. These general questions don&#8217;t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to
            improve a business. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Survey Monkey suggests that
            companies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization&#8212;and
            making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights&#8212;is what will help you
            reach your goals.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Think
            about what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent
            performance, customer loyalty to your brand, or both? Answer these questions, and you will know the
            questions to ask. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Keep the survey relevant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are
            two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how
            the request arrives. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to
            drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl,&lt;a
            href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-beacon-technology-for-retail-stores"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over
            70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a
            purchase during a store visit.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t be afraid to be bold when considering options!
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Show the value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Customers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback
            on a product or experience. Don&#8217;t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole.
            Show customers a direct correlation
            between feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor
            reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by
            trumpeting improvements made to products/services
            based on direct customer feedback. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Use the data available to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use
            to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and
            voice analytics solutions can be used to
            analyze interaction transcripts, providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view
            several different aspects of their business&#8212;products, support service options and agent interactions
            to name a few. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;With more than 15,000 employees dedicated to healthcare, our thousands of PBM advocates
            support a variety of prescription processes, ranging from mail order conversions to supporting high-risk
            specialty medication prescriptions. And unlike other partners,
            Alorica&#8217;s licensed pharmacists, certified pharmacy technicians and licensed, non-dispensing pharmacies
            provide valuable resources that can scale your operations and centralize more functions&#8212;all while
            data-driven analytics help you meet
            your business goals and enhance member and provider experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s what we call a prescription for success.&amp;nbsp;Download the overview to learn more
            about our PBM solutions, and how we can go to work for you. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winning Starts With Staying Competitive&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) represent an important and growing segment of the overall healthcare
            market, playing a key role in reducing costs and improving the value of services offered by plan sponsors.
            In today&#8217;s climate of increasing
            competition, growing enrollment and regulatory and compliance complexity, more PBMs are turning to partners
            like Alorica to help meet their business goals and improve member and provider experiences. Alorica delivers
            value through: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROLLING COSTS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Achieve a global footprint&#8212;instantly. Alorica provides you with access to top talent from the U.S. and
            around the world, specifically curated to offset rapidly rising costs that the industry is facing while
            having
            peace of mind that compliance and regulatory requirements remain a top priority. Our globally distributed
            workforce of more than 8,000 PBM-focused employees means having access to the resources you need;
            furthermore, our award-winning Work-at-Home
            agents offer you an even larger network of Registered Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians, regardless of
            geographic location. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCALABLE SOLUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            Contact volumes can fluctuate significantly for PBMs, particularly during enrollment and events such as
            industry consolidation or drug recalls. Regardless of changing call volumes, Alorica is able to seamlessly
            onboard,
            train and ramp up both licensed and unlicensed healthcare advocates to ensure your members receive the
            first-class service they have come to expect. We identify and recruit top performers, and train and equip
            representatives with the resources they
            need to exceed customer expectations. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICENSED, NON-DISPENSING PHARMACIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Some PBM work must be performed in a licensed pharmacy to satisfy legal requirements and to maintain
            compliance with your internal policies and procedures. Alorica operates two licensed, non-dispensing
            pharmacies, both registered with their state Board of Pharmacy and managed by a licensed
            Pharmacist-in-Charge; this critical resource can help streamline your operation, and drive accuracy scores.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUALITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            When it comes to pharmacy interactions, precision is paramount; cost savings are meaningless without a
            demonstrated record of exceptional quality. Through rigorous training, expert oversight and best-in-class
            processes, Alorica
            consistently meets 99.99% accuracy results. We also have a dedicated healthcare compliance team which, in
            conjunction with our experienced client solutions professionals, works to ensure optimal member outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Customers making contact expect a company to wrap together all forms of communication from
            traditional to social. In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless
            shopping experience, whether they&#8217;re shopping online
            from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support
            channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before
            heading to the store.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;By the time
            they connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they
            have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online
            community; otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t
            be calling to begin with. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing
            relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when
            reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be
            recognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent
            either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn&#8217;t possess the baseline
            capabilities the app does. It&#8217;s
            crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn&#8217;t add
            significant length to the interaction. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes,
            integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn&#8217;t
            allow for the continuous experience
            of true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result.
            Without proper redesign and integration, what&#8217;s left is a solution that causes more harm than good,
            leaving the burden on the contact center
            agent to resolve a complicated case. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing
            infrastructure to determine if you&#8217;re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions
            to best position yourself for success. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. System consolidation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research
            customer accounts and case history? &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the answer is more than one, it&#8217;s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to
            integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer
            resolution times. Remember, the more history the front
            line is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer
            experience. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Multichannel platform integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Does your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer
            touchpoints at the self-service stage? &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system
            integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social
            media, and AI, the details of these touches must
            push to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey
            details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and
            empowered customer experience. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Employee experience considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for
            enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents?
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;As employee expectations become more complex, training investments will be critical to ongoing
            success. Consider what concepts, such as routine system changes, can be easily adopted through online
            content delivery. While even the best Learning Management
            System will not replace the need for facilitator-led content, moving simple content to employee self-service
            can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and
            procedural changes to be delivered
            live in a classroom environment.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;As you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities, make sure
            your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will
            require additional expertise and research time,
            especially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity, you will
            invest in agents&#8217; knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened
            expectations and to prevent employee pool
            burnout. This will also ensure you are attracting the right level of talent for the job. With self-service
            channels resulting in reduced contact volume, the funding to provide necessary compensation adjustments
            should be readily available.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With awareness and attention to these crucial details for a seamless integration, you can
            confidently forge onward in your quest for automation. Developing a framework to address these three
            critical areas will help you avoid common pitfalls, leading
            to true omnichannel leadership. &amp;nbsp; Interested in learning more? We&#8217;re experts at providing a
            fluid omnichannel experience for several of our clients, and we&#8217;d be happy to help you find a

            &lt;p&gt;Due to the ever-changing world of business, our work at Alorica is more varied and specialized
            today than ever before. The biggest key to our success is matching the right applicant to the right
            work-type, allowing us to improve speed-to-proficiency and
            reduce attrition. The hiring landscape has changed; from digital transformation to the transition to
            work-at-home, and even to a new agile workforce. Because of this, companies must continue to focus on
            reducing unwanted turnover and improving candidate
            satisfaction. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why the Philippines?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some have called the
            Philippines &#8220;the call center capital of the world.&#8221; The Republic of the Philippines offers an
            optimal combination of economic,
            cultural and educational benefits; making it an excellent location for centers of excellence and business
            process outsourcing (BPO) companies. Listed here are just a few of the advantages the Philippines offers to
            multinational enterprises:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to Global Talent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication Skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovative
            Technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Company Delivers Promises to
            Deliver &#8220;Insanely Great&#8221; Customer Experiences? Who Glows?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frost
            &amp;amp; Sullivan believes that Alorica Philippines has inserted creativity
            and innovation into the hard stuff: BPO recruiting, hiring, training and agent retention. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why Alorica?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Innovations
            in Agent Hiring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica utilizes a robust, high-capacity recruiting and hiring engine
            using automation. The automation drives speed, agility and volume. It serves as a &#8216;first round&#8217;
            interview and candidate engagement tool; handling audio and video responses
            that capture fluency and articulation. This automated chatbot service is embedded into the Alorica
            Philippines Facebook Fan page and can be launched from there. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;What Sets Alorica Apart from other BPOs in the Philippines?&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microlearning.&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;Aimed at the new wave of Millennials, this just-in-time (JIT) training approach delivers training
            content when an agent needs it. This new training tool set offers bite-sized modules that are focused on
            specific
            learning outcomes. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;b&gt;Gamification.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given that 42% of frontline agents fall between the ages of 20
            and 36, Alorica&#8217;s gamification program appeals to the Millennial population.&amp;nbsp; Alorica in the
            Philippines utilizes gamification software
            to aid training and learning; applying game mechanics to non-game experiences to motivate high-value
            activity and loyalty while reinforcing a fun and positive culture. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Laser Focus on People&amp;nbsp; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strategic
            Onboarding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note this competitive differentiator: Alorica has developed and evolved a
            Strategic Onboarding framework and invested in a dedicated Onboarding Team to support the new hire
            experience, engaging and enabling employees in the first 90 days of employment
            with the company. The outcome is a highly motivated workforce and significantly improved agent retention.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Retention and Company Culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making
            Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) is a non-profit
            501(c)(3) charity organization in the U.S. and a non-profit organization in Philippines, Mexico, Canada and
            Panama which are not subsidiaries or owned by Alorica. Some highlights:
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MLBA Chapters raise monies via fundraisers and payroll contributions. The
            local Chapter Board determines how funds are granted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% of all Chapter
            contributions stays with that Chapter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alorica and outside donors donate all
            resources &#8211; Chapter seed money, contest money, legal, audit and bank fees, volunteers, IT and admin
            support, office supplies, call expenses, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Analyst Perspective: Key Takeaways&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Secret Sauce
            to &#8220;Insanely Great&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listed below are just a few of the ingredients that are
            baked into the Alorica Philippines&#8217; DNA, making it an &lt;u&gt;excellent&lt;/u&gt; choice for customer

        <description>&lt;h5&gt;Operational delivery to maximize performance&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Getting your team up to speed takes time&#8212;from lengthy training times, made worse by high
            attrition rates to fluctuations in hiring cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;And that puts your company and your customers in a bind, especially if your objective is to improve
            speed, performance and accuracy&#8230;because today&#8217;s customers expect more than the same old support.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;85% of interactions with a business will exist without person-to-person communication&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;58% average agent turnover rate due largely to attrition&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            implement target areas for improvement in attracting, onboarding, training, and enabling agents in the first

            &lt;ol&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;Self-paced training though an interactive app that feels like a video game&#8212;complete with
            motivational music and digital rewards for achievements&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recruiting typically requires a series of prescreening, phone calls and in-person
            interviews, but modern technology is removing a lot of the stress from the process. Now, multiple candidates
            can conveniently apply for jobs at any hour through chatbots,
            and then hiring teams can review the interview transcripts to find potential matches for available
            positions.&#8239;And because today&#8217;s increasingly complicated customer service conversations require
            highly proficient agents with the right personalities
            and skill-sets, hiring analytics can help contact centers quickly assess the best-fit talent up front. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For automakers, dealerships, drivers and riders, the integration&amp;nbsp;of new
            technology is changing the way the automotive&amp;nbsp;industry operates. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already happily accept rides with strangers through popular&amp;nbsp;ride-hailing
            apps, and soon self-driving cars will zip us around.&amp;nbsp;Yet having our own vehicles remains desirable
            to many, and&amp;nbsp;car manufacturers are eager to provide what car
            buyers want.&amp;nbsp;Rearview backup cameras, hands-free phone integration and&amp;nbsp;touchscreen
            navigation are all modern conveniences that drivers&amp;nbsp;rely on today, and with these added features
            comes the need for&amp;nbsp;prompt and courteous customer
            support. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alorica has solutions that keep both car and driver connected.&amp;nbsp;Our automotive
            agents calm fender-bender victims, rectify&amp;nbsp;rental car snafus and clarify confusing auto warranties.
            And&amp;nbsp;when an auto parts recall or otherwise urgent matter arises,&amp;nbsp;we&#8217;re
            equipped to scale up resources to handle the influx&amp;nbsp;of incoming calls. Whether a ride-sharing teen
            needs app&amp;nbsp;support or a business executive&#8217;s luxury sedan requires routine&amp;nbsp;maintenance,
            Alorica strives to provide best-in-class
            service to&amp;nbsp;customers across multiple geographies through voice, email,&amp;nbsp;chat and social
            media. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s ride on, shall we? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;ALORICA
            IN ACTION: ON-DEMAND TRANSPORTATION PROVIDER&lt;/h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h5&gt;Scalability and Speed to Proficiency&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fast-growing, on-demand transportation
            provider required flexible, rapid ramp-ups and turned to Alorica for help. In a year&#8217;s time, they
            added five new LOBs and ramped more than 600 agents in both domestic and offshore locations. &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a review of the client&#8217;s training program, we noticed inefficiencies in the
            40-hour onboarding curriculum being delivered via instructor-led, classroom training. Together, we realigned
            the learning focus with a more hands-on approach, reducing
            training time to 12 hours and improving time to proficiency for agents to meet quality targets. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now provide 24/7 support for the client&#8217;s Document Review, Fraud, Mentor, Driver
            Safety, Guardian, Passenger and Driver lines of business. We&#8217;re also responsible for supporting the
            client&#8217;s trademarked computer software, which keeps
            drivers and passengers connected throughout their entire transaction. From selecting a preferred vehicle or
            driver (or passengers) pre-ride to rating the driver (or passengers) post-ride, our agents are always
            available to help should the users from
            either end require assistance with our client&#8217;s app. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&amp;nbsp;Automotive
            Expertise&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CUSTOMERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recalls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case

            and&amp;nbsp;Repurchase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;


            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINANCIAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Account Resolutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fraud

            &lt;h5 style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personalized Digital Solutions + Seamless Customer Experiences
            = Higher CSAT, FCR and NPS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to
            convert transactional interactions to long-term customer satisfaction in BFSI&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="text-align: left"&gt;Here at Alorica&#8212;a global Customer Experience (CX) provider&#8212;I lead
            the efforts in engaging some of the most reputable financial institutions in the world to offer our customer
            support services as an extension of their business. One great question
            I get asked often from financial services executives is&#8212;&lt;i&gt;how should they integrate &#8216;digital&#8217;
            in a meaningful way to earn customers&#8217; satisfaction, trust and long-term business?&lt;/i&gt; The
            reality is consumers expect personalized
            service from the companies they do business with. And while for some industries, like retail, that&#8217;s
            innately part of every brand&#8217;s identity; for others, like the banking, financial services, and
            insurance sector (BFSI), giving customers
            the digital experiences they want isn&#8217;t so simple. Here are some of BFSI&#8217;s challenges and the
            best ways to solve for them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make
            It Personal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers, particularly in the wake of the
            pandemic, have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels,
            elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial
            institutions know them&#8212;especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information.
            For many large institutions, the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause
            additional frustration. As a personal
            example, when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card, the
            customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not
            integrated. This made me feel undervalued
            as their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX
            solutions, built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML, along with system integration, can
            help create tailored product recommendations,
            savings plans, and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. &lt;a
            href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/what-does-personalization-banking-really-mean" target="_blank"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;As Boston Consulting Group shared&lt;/a&gt;:
            &#8220;Ultimately, if done well, personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of
            customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking, it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for
            banks.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give Them Options&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-banking-study-reveals-growth-benefits-of-personalization-innovation-and-trust-in-customer-experience-301674711.html"
            target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude&lt;/a&gt;,
            financial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the
            channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver
            more rapid responses, the need
            to keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for
            BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use
            multiple channels to complete transactions,
            it can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will
            want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging
            situation. The customer will want
            to be heard, discuss their options, and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank
            employee will guide them through the process. That&#8217;s why balance and optionality are key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-service
            options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel
            solutions, enhanced self-service options, improved functionality across digital channels, and 24/7 live
            support can help reduce the friction,
            streamline disparate outcomes, and make digital options easier for everyone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Partnerships
            You Can Bank On&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in &lt;a
            href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/getting-personal-how-banks-can-win-with-consumers"
            target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&#8217;s 2022 article&lt;/a&gt;:
            &#8220;for
            many [banks], a key struggle is that customer information is housed in different ways across the business
            and stove piped within functions, preventing the bank from gaining a complete view of the customer,&#8221;
            but by partnering with a CX expert
            who knows how to deliver the right blend of people, processes, and technology, customers can get the
            personal experiences they want from the BFSI brands they do business with. Whether it&#8217;s adding
            automation technology with a human touch that
            can support multiple product types or creating seamless omnichannel experiences, an experienced partner with
            scale, security, compliance, and digital solutions built in, can ensure optimal digital CX at every
            interaction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately, when customers
            feel like they are understood, and they can trust us&#8212;especially with their finances&#8212; their
            financial institution&#8217;s wallet share grows. A strategic CX partner who knows how to deliver
            people-first, flexible
            and secure solutions at scale across industries makes all the difference in earning LTV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;table style="border-style: none"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="width: 12.3644%; text-align:
            left; vertical-align: top; border: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img data-method="ResizeFitToAreaArguments"

            style="width: 87.6385%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; border: none"&gt;&lt;font color="#3a82a7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.
            Executive Sponsorship and Engagement:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;A partnership with executive
            stakeholders &#8211; sharing ideas, concerns, needs and expectations &#8211; clearing roadblocks and
            accelerating decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#f58025"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bene&#64257;ts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
            With early involvement, as your partner, we can properly identify strategies and solutions, set smart goals
            and validate/adjust strategies for desired outcomes. Establishing leadership and sharing long-term
            strategy, leads to a reduction of short-term, reactive projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As companies care more about doing good in the world, they&#8217;re selecting partners who
            share their same passion. International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (&lt;a
            href="https://www.iaop.org/"&gt;IAOP&lt;/a&gt;) recently launched its long-awaited Social Responsibility in
            Outsourcing (SRO) Chapter with its inaugural webinar, &#8220;The Evolution of Socially Responsible
            Outsourcing: Relevant Now More Than Ever.&#8221; Participating in the webinar, included Alorica&#8217;s
            Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee, along with representatives from other leading organizations including
            Facebook, Microsoft, Sprint and BSR.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For the webinar, Alorica represented service providers in the BPO industry, offering our take on
            the benefit and impact of a CSR program. Besides the obvious reasons that it&#8217;s the right thing to do
            and our clients care about it, Alorica believes being socially responsible is &#8220;&lt;strong&gt;just good
            business&lt;/strong&gt;.&#8221; Being in the people-to-people business, our employees are truly our greatest
            assets, thus we pay attention to what attracts them, motivates them and keeps them. The result? We&#8217;ve
            created a culture of giving back, connection and empowerment through our CSR programs.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So how do we do that? One way is through our partnership with &lt;a href="https://livesbetter.org/"&gt;Making
            Lives Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt; (MLBA), a global non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of people
            in need around the world. Alorica employees lead the nearly 100 chapters worldwide, where they are empowered
            to support individuals, local organizations and communities that matter most to them. In less than four
            years, MLBA chapters have raised and distributed millions of dollars in grants and disaster relief, and our
            clients are noticing these efforts! One example is through our partnership with Intuit where we were
            selected to help with their latest impact sourcing project, establishing a &lt;a
            href="https://www.bdtonline.com/news/things-are-falling-into-place-intuit-hiring-going-strong-at/article_0412c28e-c6d7-11e9-b829-b7a2a793f6a2.html"&gt;Prosperity
            Hub&lt;/a&gt; in Bluefield, W. Va. This initiative will bring hundreds of jobs, providing locals with career
            opportunities and support through MLBA, with the end goal of helping the people there to help themselves and
            their own community.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            efficiency, rebadging its contact center in China was the clear strategic choice. As a result, the client

            &lt;p&gt;When a client was looking to drive more members to its loyalty program, they turned to a group that
            could transform information into insights&#8212;and win back their valued customers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Increase adoption of their loyalty program&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Improve the win-back of members who hadn&#8217;t used&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;the loyalty program for more than six months&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The program generated a profit of $10 million&#8212;130% of the client&#8217;s goal&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The full solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group, and 19% over the
            client&#8217;s internal sales team&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE CLIENT&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So here&#8217;s what happened. A major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for
            Small/Medium Business (SMB) accounts. The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program, and to
            improve the win-back of members
            who hadn&#8217;t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE PROGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1&lt;/strong&gt; of the solution involved utilizing Alorica&#8217;s data
            scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan
            and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring
            Model), comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling, was thusly launched.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2&lt;/strong&gt; implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data
            scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3&lt;/strong&gt; saw Alorica providing full account management of the client&#8217;s
            loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client&#8217;s profitability.
            Meanwhile, a sales CRM system and digital sales strategy
            intelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics. And our CAE came through in
            the clutch, delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer, resulting in an
            optimal contact strategy, increased
            positive customer experiences and higher revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;h4&gt;THE RESULTS&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The revised Welcome Program increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%.
            Meanwhile, the win-back program increased usage by 37%, generating a profit of $10 million &#8211; 130% of
            the client&#8217;s goal. And to top it off, the full account management and analytical solution improved
            sales results more than 25% over the control group, and 19% over the client&#8217;s internal inside sales
            team.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turns out, when you don&#8217;t do everything by the numbers,
            you end up with some pretty good numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better CX begins with actionable customer interaction analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interaction Analytics&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;leverages customer interactions data (voice and
            text) to improve operational performance, gain customer insights and drive loyalty. And when it comes to
            driving improvements across an entire organization, nothing&#8217;s more
            effective at delivering:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Improved customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Streamlined efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Reduced operating costs&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Increased revenue&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Reduced customer churn&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Continuously optimized and improved CX&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drilling down with actionable insights is more important than ever. And every day you don&#8217;t,
            can cost you. If you haven&#8217;t explored how Interaction Analytics can help improve your CX and more, you&#8217;re
            leaving money and opportunity on the
            table&#8230;every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

            an appreciation for the creativity of writing, advertising and graphic design, Tonya Goforth pursued a
            degree in Business Management with an emphasis in Marketing. Since college, she&#8217;s navigated her way
            through different positions in various
            industries, gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now,
            as Alorica&#8217;s Director of Sales Enablement, she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by
            assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&amp;amp;A
            below.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;How did you reach your career goal of becoming a director?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person
            was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital
            part of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that
            director didn&#8217;t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I&#8217;d be
            a great fit. My &#8220;stick-to-it-ness&#8221;
            paid off!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What do you find most rewarding in your role?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;Seeing my team&#8217;s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we&#8217;re
            always working with several different people. Being in this
            central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear
            that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;I would definitely say (now Alorica&#8217;s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly
            Hanak-Weaver, who I reported to as a proposal
            manager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team, while empowering them, too. I try to copy off her
            great leadership style&#8212;we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;What&#8217;s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path?&lt;/font&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;At any job, it&#8217;s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend
            on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your
            career changes, you&#8217;ll find that by maintaining a professional network, you&#8217;ll always have
            connections available for referrals, advice and encouragement.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any additional advice for work life?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;Don&#8217;t
            be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible
            and open to change. And roll with challenging
            situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself
            in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

            friendship made in Alorica heaven &#8230; but this dynamic duo didn&#8217;t exactly start off on the right

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beginning.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Before Genet and Lori met each other, they
            were living a parallel course. Both joined El Paso East as agents and they were equally determined to move
            up the ranks. As they progressed through their leadership journey, little
            did they know&amp;nbsp;

            Manager in five years. I was so excited that in just a matter of months, I was offered a Team Manager
            position!&#8221; Lori explained. She
            was moving on up. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &#8230; her upcoming vacation was going to be even
            better knowing she was returning to her new role! She couldn&#8217;t wait to get back to work and was eager
            to meet her new boss. Of course, she was a little nervous because, after all, first impressions
            are everything! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lori returned to work, she was reassured that her new
            team had performed well in her absence &lt;i&gt;&#8230; because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation
            to make sure of it. (Uh-oh!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;And now, Genet&#8217;s
            side of the story.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It was 2014 and Genet was elated to be offered a promotion from Team
            Manager to Shift Manager. Her leadership dreams were coming true! Not only was she killing it at work, she
            also had a vacation
            planned soon. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were definitely going her way. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or
            so she thought. Genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as Team Manager, Ms. Lori Melendez,
            had already requested personal time off. Therefore, Genet, as Lori&#8217;s new boss, needed to skip her own
            vacation! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Genet wasn&#8217;t thrilled about this change of
            events. &#8220;Who IS this Lori person? She&#8217;s taking my team AND my vacation?!&#8221; Genet exclaimed.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unexpected friendships are the best ones.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#8220;Genet had
            to skip her vacation so I could take MINE!&#8221; Lori was horrified. This is not the way she wanted to
            start things off with her new boss! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, they were able to laugh about
            it. And they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s
            why, a few months later, when Genet received another promotion as Operations Manager for El Paso&#8217;s
            Outbound Team, she immediately invited Lori to be her Team Manager. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only
            did Genet and Lori successfully lead their team &#8230; they were ranked the #1 Outbound Team in Alorica.
            Because of their &lt;b&gt;passion&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;performance&lt;/b&gt; and belief in limitless &lt;b&gt;possibilities&lt;/b&gt;,
            they were eventually asked to oversee
            the Inbound Team too. What a major undertaking! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, four years later, Genet
            and Lori are inseparable. Genet is leading the Inbound Team as Operations Manager. Lori achieved her goal as
            the Operations Manager of Outbound. And both departments are #1. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Way to go,
            Lori and Genet! Thank you for your perseverance and determination and for proving great things can happen
            when you least expect it. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s start with the bad news first. There&#8217;s a general consensus amongst
            financial experts that the markets are poised to pull back in the next 12-18 months. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving
            this downturn is the fact that millennials&#8212;&lt;em&gt;the largest generation in the U.S. labor force&lt;/em&gt;&#8212;are
            buying houses and vehicles while contending with an enormous amount of student debt. In the past year alone,
            credit card loans have
            increased by 5%&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the percentage of seriously delinquent borrowers (90+ DPD) grew
            11 basis points to 1.89%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than be caught off-guard, many companies are taking steps now to prepare for the
            downturn. CEOs are tasking their leadership with implementing cost-saving initiatives, enhancing operational
            efficiencies and adapting to a pressure-driven economy.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;re feeling a little flat-footed about your current operation, don&#8217;t
            fret&#8212;there&#8217;s still time to mobilize! &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;&lt;a

            &lt;p&gt;Do you remember what you were doing 10 years ago? Well WE do! On &lt;strong&gt;March 17, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;,
            we were taking our first calls in Guatemala! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This &#8220;diamond&#8221; milestone took place at our first site in the country&#8212;Primma 1&#8212;with
            the inaugural call taken by our very own Mark Van Der Beek, General Manager at Alorica Tetra and WTC sites.
            Joining the Alorica family in February
            2009, he still remembers that day like it was yesterday! And while we can&#8217;t disclose the client, 10
            years later, not only are we still servicing this worldwide telecom provider, but it is one of our largest
            clients in the country. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a decade, we have continued to grow in the land of "Libre Crezca Fecundo" (Grow Free and
            Fertile), with nearly 6,000 employees filling our 5 sites&#8212;Campus, Primma 1, Primma 2, Tetra and WTC&#8212;and
            servicing global brands that span an array
            of industries including retail, communications, media and entertainment, energy and others. Establishing
            ourselves as a leading BPO employer in Guatemala, our modern contact centers reflect our people-first
            culture. Our goal as a company is to also
            go beyond meeting our employees&#8217; expectations for their career. We&#8217;ve made significant
            investments in our global team, and offer a variety of free extended education

            such as Alorica Language Institute, which offers English proficiency classes,
            to Alorica Academy, which teaches skills related to the industry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today as we honor this milestone, we congratulate the Aloricans in Guatemala who continue to make
            lives better, one interaction at a time. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A major multi-state, regulated power utility in the Southeast United States was concerned
            that it was growing faster than its local workforce could support. Seeking a long-term solution, the client
            entrusted Alorica to manage all customer service operations.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results led to agents reaching speed-to-proficiency 33% faster than projected, and the creation
            of an environment capable of transformation and digital adoption. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Global non-profit &lt;a href="http://www.livesbetter.org"&gt;Making Lives Better with
            Alorica&lt;/a&gt; (MLBA), announced it has expanded into its sixth country, Guatemala with four chapters
            &#8211; Campus, Primma, Tetra and WTC &#8211; at
            local Alorica contact centers. By expanding into the country, MLBA will positively affect more than 5,000
            Alorica employees, their families and local communities. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica proudly partners with MLBA to help fulfill its vision of &lt;em&gt;making lives better&lt;/em&gt;
            and continue the culture of paying it forward, a defining characteristic of the company. Elizabeth Dorris,
            Division Vice President, Guatemala &amp;amp; Honduras
            says of the expansion, &#8220;MLBA offers a unique approach to corporate philanthropy, giving Alorica
            employees the decision-making power to support local causes and individuals that matter most to them. I&#8217;m
            excited to see how these chapters
            will support the people of Guatemala.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The news of MLBA&#8217;s expansion into &lt;a href="/insights/resource/meet-alorica-guatemala/"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;
            comes on the heels of Alorica celebrating its &lt;a
            href="/insights/resource/celebrating-a-decade-spent-making-lives-better-in-guatemala/"&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
            year in business in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Joyce Lee, Alorica&#8217;s Chief Culture Officer and President of
            MLBA, says, &#8220;As Alorica celebrates its 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary in the country, it
            seemed more
            than fitting to honor this milestone by expanding MLBA into Guatemala.&#8221; Striving to attract and retain
            the talented people of Guatemala, Alorica has redefined the contact center environment to reflect its
            people-first culture, offering impactful
            learning programs to benefits, such as an on-site clinic, free daycare, transportation services and tuition
            discounts. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since its inception nearly four years ago, employee-led MLBA chapters have raised nearly $4.5
            million dollars through Alorica payroll contributions and fundraisers. Of the funds collected, more than
            7,750 grants have been awarded &#8211; totaling in excess
            of $3.5 million.&amp;nbsp;In addition, when local areas are hit hard by natural disasters (i.e. hurricane,
            flooding) or other crises, MLBA assists impacted employees, families and communities through its Disaster
            Relief Fund. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Get to know the best duo since peanut butter and &lt;del&gt;jelly&lt;/del&gt; chocolate.
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you want to generate revenue, you&#8217;ll want to read on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
            it&#8217;s time to move beyond the status quo, companies start to explore incorporating revenue generating
            programs into their client offering. But finding a customizable solution that will generate revenue for your
            company while meeting your specific
            metrics and addressing unique challenges can be daunting. We&#8217;d recommend starting your search by
            reading our brochure: &lt;a href="https://www.alorica.com/insights/resource/make-it-rain-alorica-boost"
            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;MAKING IT RAIN: Enhancing your bottom line with Alorica&lt;/a&gt;.
            Need another reason? It&#8217;s a faster read than &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A
            major element of our revenue generation solution is the role of the &lt;b&gt;Dialer Manager. &lt;/b&gt;Not
            simply a regular position on the floor, these specialized team members deal with all inbound/outbound data
            pertaining to your program. They also
            manage lead lists and create effective dialing strategies &#8211; strategies that let us reach the right
            customers, at the right time, with the right message. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dialer Managers: Behind the scenes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generating
            revenue comes down to dialing strategy and applying research and analytics in such a way that your customers
            are contacted effectively and efficiently. Strategies are born from knowledgeable interpretation of this
            analysis, and are tweaked
            according to program successes and stumbles. In addition to managing the lead lists, the DM applies filters,
            oversees land line/cell phone allocation, scores agent skills and analyzes historical and interval reporting
            to identify critical trends.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, the easy stuff. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialer Managers are
            uber-important in the revenue generation process, because they are at the heart of improving agent
            performance and overall customer experience. They also play a large role in compliance &#8211; making sure
            we observe local and federal
            dialing regulations, splitting up lead lists to conform with cell phone directives and working closely with
            QA teams to ensure all calls are properly handled and monitored. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our
            Dialer Managers are just part of our proprietary sales process, &lt;b&gt;Boost&lt;/b&gt;. What&#8217;s
            Boost, you ask? Well, you&#8217;ll just have to read that brochure we told you about. Sorry. You&#8217;re
            officially out of excuses. &amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A company&#8217;s performance can&#8217;t be driven by simply setting goals or measuring
            KPIs. It&#8217;s leaders who play the most pivotal role in driving an organization&#8217;s success because a
            good leader can be a key reason why an employee joins, stays at or leaves a company. Below are a few
            strategies that I have found to be vital in establishing a work environment where employees thrive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;1. Cultivate a culture of accountability:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:
            60px"&gt;Recognizing that mistakes are an inevitable part of the development process fosters a
            learning-oriented environment rather than one solely focused on results. Encouraging employees to
            acknowledge their errors and learn from them not only enables them to feel like they can try new or hard
            things, but also helps boost employee satisfaction and confidence. #BeBold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;2. Lead by example:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;By taking the time to walk your employees through your thought process and
            actions for a project or challenge, they&#8217;re able to quickly learn what to do. Especially if it&#8217;s
            their first time, they can benefit from your experience and expertise. It also connects you more to your
            team, which leads to trust, engagement and high performance. #BeConnected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:
            60px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;3. Instill a forward-focused vision:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;Don&#8217;t just give employees tasks or projects to complete. Constantly
            reinforce what the company&#8217;s goals are and how their work makes a difference. Empower employees to
            make decisions in their day-to-day work by helping them think about the company&#8217;s&#8212;and their own&#8212;long-term
            success. Create a vision, articulate it regularly and share updates on the progress to achieving it. This
            will allow them to stay committed and focused on accomplishing sustainable growth. #BeRelentless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
            style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a leader, it&#8217;s our responsibility to
            support our people to reach their full potential. That&#8217;s what most positively impacts the overall
            success of an organization. And most of all, have integrity in every action. #BeTrue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What
            are some leadership strategies that work for you? &lt;a

            quote can speak volumes about a person&#8217;s mindset. Rita Saavedra Ortiz, Alorica&#8217;s Site Director
            in Kingston, Jamaica, says that she references this Ralph Waldo Emerson quote often: &#8220;Do not go where
            the path may lead, go instead
            where there is no path and leave a trail.&#8221; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita&#8217;s personal story
            certainly fulfills that mantra. She started out as an agent in 2004, moved into quality nine months later,
            and then switched to operations in 2011. Just a handful of months ago, in January 2018, she moved from
            Panama to Jamaica
            to take on her newest challenge at the Kingston site. By seizing opportunities as they come, Rita continues
            to grow and learn in her career, and she inspires others around her to do the same. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read her full Q&amp;amp;A below: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: How has working at Alorica specifically
            led to your personal career growth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; When I started working in
            operations seven years ago, I learned the biggest lessons in my career. One of my
            mentors said, if you fail, just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your
            comfort zone. So, I started out with a small account, and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it&#8212;the
            exposure with the client, getting
            into calls with client solutions, making decisions about what is good for the business, and getting to know
            the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big, new site in Jamaica, I knew I could do
            it even though it would be new for
            me. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: What motivates you every day?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt;
            I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable
            you are with yourself, the better you can overcome
            the roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you
            look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes, whether
            good or bad. The fourth one is to
            get to know your people&#8212;not only at the professional level, but at the personal level. Talking to
            people builds loyalty, and that&#8217;s how you get people to not work for you, but to work with you. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: If you could change anything in your
            career trajectory up until now, what would it be and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; Sometimes
            I think, what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every
            decision I&#8217;ve made, good or not so good, they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with
            everything I have accomplished. I wouldn&#8217;t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to
            training, I didn&#8217;t want to leave, but
            it was a good decision. From there, I got to try new things. There&#8217;s so many branches in this
            business. You&#8217;d be surprised about what you might succeed in.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Can you think of an example when you
            faced pushback at work because you were female?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I have never felt
            that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I&#8217;ve seen many women
            in this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in
            a man&#8217;s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama, and I was the first woman to take
            leadership of a group of rescuers. I
            was able to stand up and lead that task. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Do you think it is important to be a
            mentor?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; Right now, my team is spread all over Panama, and I am
            still mentoring them. When I see my people growing, being insanely great even when
            we aren&#8217;t together, I feel proud of myself. I am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan.
            You have to have someone else who can take care of your programs, like a mini me. Mentoring is really
            important.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/default-source/insights/1559057400_automation.png?sfvrsn=d2d29d5e_0"&gt;&lt;img
            src="/images/default-source/insights/1559057400_automation.png?sfvrsn=d2d29d5e_0" height="197"
            class="wp-image-23310 alignleft" width="471" alt="automation image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the first stumbling blocks of business process transformation is identifying meaningful
            automation opportunities. A typical process will have a management consultant, system expert, or Lean Six
            Sigma specialist to monitor manual processes for a
            set time, collect performance data, and make recommendations. Companies supplement this assessment with
            executive ideation sessions, operational managers&#8217; workshops, and superuser interviews. The
            traditional way to speed up and improve the accuracy
            of this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet,
            despite these efforts, not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and
            prioritized. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In this blog, I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline
            &#8216;the discovery stage&#8217; and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From manual to automated discovery&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage, calling it &#8216;One-Click
            Automation&#8217;. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents&#8217; desktop utilization on
            a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors
            the users&#8217; screen toggle, clicks, data entries and entry type, and tracks time per system and per
            screen, the time duration for performing each step, and the number of used fields. It counts errors,
            frequency, variance in the time and data entry
            quality, the end-to-end handling time, the complexity, and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the
            underlying communication between systems and exchanged information. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bot does not capture personal data or other input information, remaining non-invasive to the
            systems. It also does not intervene with the users&#8217; actions. Once the bot collects enough information
            (~100k data points per LOB, typically in two weeks),
            it creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens, the start and end
            points, the navigation between them, and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product
            portfolios with multiple support processes
            (for example, in technical support), Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru,
            launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results, estimate savings
            opportunities, and recommend and prioritize bot implementations
            with workflow business process, exceptions adjudicator, and look-up. Because the collected information shows
            the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data, the created automation workflows make
            the bot training quicker and
            more precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementations for a healthcare client&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For a U.S. healthcare payer client, Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant
            number of agent desktops for three days, identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with
            tasks such as secondary claims research, multifactor
            case, clinical guidelines, and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of
            agents who performed the particular process, its recurrence, and time taken. The team compared the results
            to the agent training guidelines, then
            Alorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and
            productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client&#8217;s voice and non-voice work. For
            example, in the client&#8217;s back-office, the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from
            image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax.
            Using third-party RPA &amp;amp; AI partner tools, Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields
            regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or
            compliance requirements such as HIPAA.
            It also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots
            runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount
            who translated the data from the
            claims to the systems. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a
            &#8216;digital workbench&#8217; for back-office processes, leading with automation. For automation
            opportunities in voice processes, Alorica is working
            with several travel, retail, BFSI, media and telecom brands. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation in the process trenches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume,
            time-consuming processes, sizable FTE involvement, high error rate, or simply, risk aversion by internal IT
            teams. To address the latter issue, Alorica automation
            deployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising, changing or modifying core client systems.
            The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion
            with the client&#8217;s process owners
            on the possible cost-benefit and ROI. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with
            dynamic changes of internal rules, product/services, and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will
            be quite short and its ROI smaller without human
            supervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated
            desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the
            challenge of identifying process impact. To
            mitigate automation program redesigns, Alorica&#8217;s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure
            with a steady release roadmap. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost
            optimization and improved performance, Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet, looking to take
            over higher value processes, and switching to performance-based
            pricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client, Alorica structured the pricing by processed
            claim, decreasing the overall cost by ~50%. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The value of partnering for automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While broad statements for full automation attract media attention, the reality for most companies
            is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer
            satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider
            can deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario, where the vendor has the process and domain
            expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and
            supplier network centers to maximize
            the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past three years, during the season of love and in partnership with non-profit
            &lt;a href="http://www.livesbetter.org"&gt;Making Lives Better with Alorica&lt;/a&gt;, the nearly 100
            Alorica employee-led Chapters around the world participated
            in the &#8220;Share the &#9829;&#8221; contest. Chapters were tasked to demonstrate and post on Facebook how
            they shared the love in their community. To make the contest a little more interesting and in celebration of
            Alorica&#8217;s 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;anniversary,
            Chapters were also encouraged to incorporate this milestone into the photos they shared. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;And the winner is&#8230; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/Making-Lives-Better-with-Alorica-Panama-617201538682716/"&gt;Panama West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!
            &lt;br&gt;
            The Panama West Chapter partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.fundacreoenti.com/"&gt;Fundaci&#243;n Creo en
            Ti&lt;/a&gt; (I Believe in You), an organization that fosters 65 young boys during the school year. And it
            just so happens
            that the non-profit is also celebrating its 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary this year. School
            supplies and personal items were donated during the visit.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="-align-center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:

            &lt;p&gt;But let&#8217;s face it, we&#8217;re all winners here. Here is a recap of how a few of our other
            Chapters shared the &#9829;: &amp;nbsp;

            &lt;br&gt;
            Taking second place in the contest, the employees of Tucson West shared the &#9829; twice in their

            they collected socks and a variety of hygiene products, distributing them to the homeless. They also donated

            children to fight poverty through education. The boxes were filled with classroom essentials including
            notebooks, paper, pencils, crayons, rulers, glue, pens,&amp;nbsp;and they even arranged the boxes to pay
            homage to Alorica&#8217;s 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;

            faced with a career opportunity, is your inclination to go for it or to question your qualifications? Having
            the confidence to put yourself out there, whether you have the exact matching skill set or not, is one of
            the best learning opportunities
            there is according to Sharon Leal, Alorica&#8217;s Director, Operations based in San Antonio, Texas. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a &#8220;leap of faith&#8221; and joined
            the BPO industry--and she hasn&#8217;t looked back since. She&#8217;s a huge believer in speaking up, asking
            questions, and helping others achieve career growth.
            Read her full Q&amp;amp;A below: &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: How have mentors helped you in your
            career?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I&#8217;ve always had great mentors. Early in my career, a
            mentor told me, &#8220;don&#8217;t expect what you don&#8217;t inspect.&#8221; Don&#8217;t
            assume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: &#8220;listen
            to understand.&#8221; We sit and we listen, but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you
            need to so you can lead and
            be successful. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Can you share an example of how asking
            questions helped you to succeed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; When I got the call back on my
            application for this company, I asked to speak to someone who was currently in this
            position, and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the
            site director position, I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks.
            I went through agent training,
            I took calls, I sat with the QA team, I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be
            set up for success, to have credibility, and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can&#8217;t be
            afraid to ask, and asking isn&#8217;t
            a weakness. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: Do you think there is still a glass
            ceiling? Why or why not?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I was told at my previous job when I got
            to a director level that I was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman.
            I told them I don&#8217;t agree, I have worked really hard, I earned this position, and it wasn&#8217;t just
            given to me. I don&#8217;t see this at Alorica. Females can underestimate themselves, and sometimes aren&#8217;t
            confident enough to say,
            &#8220;I want to move to the next level.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never been shy about that. Show your confidence,
            shake a hand, stand up, and show that you know your business. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: What aspects of the company stand out to
            you as an employee?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;My goal is to continue to learn everything
            Alorica has available to us. I&#8217;m on the board of directors of MLBA, and I
            love that we can help employees. I love everything Alorica is doing with social media&#8212;that continues
            to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees. Culture is very important. There are
            25 other call centers in San Antonio,
            but people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b
            style="color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"&gt;Q: How do you inspire others to grow in their careers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt;
            When I am mentoring or working with someone, I find out where they want to go and what they need to do that.
            You&#8217;ve got to have
            goals, work hard, and not wait on opportunities, even if you&#8217;re not an exact match. I&#8217;ll do a
            mock interview with you, and I&#8217;ll look at your credentials. Sometimes people want a bachelor&#8217;s
            degree&#8212;but, well, I don&#8217;t
            have one! But if you have experience and show your results, you may be the most qualified candidate. Don&#8217;t
            be afraid to apply, and learn from the experience. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or
            service, is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four
            key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer
            support call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Know Your Customer&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segmentation is powerful.&amp;nbsp; When your customers ask for assistance, it&#8217;s
            important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment.
            Demographic information goes without saying, but focus should also be
            given to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;of customer a person is.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long have they been a customer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many of
            your products do they own?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How often are they reaching out for support?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;What
            past issues have they needed assistance with?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having this insight helps in the
            way you communicate with the customer later, while also helping you understand how to position self-service
            and working to find the right solution. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Identify the Problem&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may
            seem simple, but often, companies are not collecting information around&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;
            the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is
            critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better
            self-service content, while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus
            on driving improvements. In the Forrester article, &#8220;&lt;em&gt;Insights-Driven Business Set the Pace
            for Global Growth&#8221;, &lt;/em&gt;Forrester
            references that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with
            close-looped learning processes.&#8221;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era
            where information changes so rapidly, the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better
            for the customer, the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their
            support experience. However, it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to
            resolve the issue. The more effort required, the more the experience
            deteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

            data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Deflecting Call Volume&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;resolution is identified as
            the largest
            influencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only
            detrimental to experience scores, but also, they are expensive to support. Therefore, understanding what
            drives and prevents resolution is a critical
            component of your contact reduction strategy.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we
            think of resolution, we think of it two ways.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Contact Resolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It&#8217;s
            crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this
            information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or
            knowledgebase articles are solving your customer&#8217;s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your
            opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content, potentially reducing support calls and
            driving improvement in customer support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue Resolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Issue
            resolution is a measurement of whether the customer&#8217;s issue was resolved. It&#8217;s important to
            understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where
            you typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred, escalation to a higher level of
            support, etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved, you will likely
            see an impact to their overall experience
            given the delay in resolution. Remember, resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain
            customer loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Build Brand Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best
            indicators of a customer&#8217;s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will
            recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem
            will allow you to better
            understand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information
            is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn
            will set you apart from others in your industry.&amp;nbsp; In a recent blog by COPC, &#8220;The Value of
            Listening: How feedback can be an
            opportunity to bring brand image to life,&#8221; the author mentions that customers are paying more
            attention to how a brand responds than ever before.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;As
            you better understand your customer segment, how often they call,
            the types of issues that occur for them, what upsets them and the speed with which&amp;nbsp;you can help
            them, you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar
            customers. When you listen to your customers
            and begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner, you reduce the
            frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your
            customers. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a
            support model that simplifies the path to your customers&#8217; resolution is important. As you leverage
            learnings from your customers&#8217; experiences and incorporate those into your
            ever-changing support model, you begin to reduce the number of support calls required, the length of the
            call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of
            your support model will go down and you
            will gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their
            problems. Customers know issues will arise, but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what
            will set you apart from your competition.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Shaming our youth is a tradition as old as dirt. In recent history Generation X was known
            as a group of &#8220;Slackers.&#8221; Before Gen X, the original &#8220;ME&#8221; generation was the &#8220;Hippies&#8221;,
            the Baby Boomers who are now so worried
            about these &#8220;lazy, entitled, narcissistic&#8221; Millennials. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You can&#8217;t understand anyone accurately when you&#8217;re judging them&#8230; and that&#8217;s
            exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://achievemulti.wpengine.com/mi/files/2015/08/MIR_KeyTakeaways-2.pdf"&gt;Damar Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said,
            &#8220;I find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have
            encountered many who are thoughtful, resourceful, open-minded and even visionary community stewards &#8230;
            Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.&#8221;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;And
            for
            contact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce, Millennials are now the largest
            generation in the U.S. labor market&#8212;with 56 million now working.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly, get to
            know them as individuals. You&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground!
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly, we
            haven&#8217;t. This is one &#8220;way that it&#8217;s always been done&#8221; that it&#8217;s time to let go
            of, and here are 6 great reasons why. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Data doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Millennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic,
            feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind, the reality is that they are
            not that different from the generations that came
            before them.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;While the data we read may be statistically accurate, much of
            it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science&#8212;like the
            reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup
            Organization&#8212;while accurate, doesn&#8217;t tell the context of the Millennial experience. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Why? Because these surveys don&#8217;t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new
            life stage called &#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"&gt;emerging adulthood&lt;/a&gt;&#8221;.
            According to Haydn
            Shaw, generational and cultural differences expert, recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28
            is important because, &#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"&gt;if it&#8217;s the
            Millennials&lt;/a&gt;,
            then it&#8217;s a problem that needs to be fixed&#8230;if it&#8217;s a life stage, it&#8217;s a change that
            we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.&#8221; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Millennials work to live, not live to work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Millennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives&#8212;even above their
            careers.&amp;nbsp;According to Darlene Corbett, a therapist and success coach, &#8220;like many generations
            before Millennials, marriage and family are part of
            the big picture for the Millennial population.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;fulfill
            career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for
            leadership development,
            they should create a work environment that respects personal values, especially related to family. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Find ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to
            build a great career without damaging their personal relationships. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. Millennials desire personal growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Work-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the
            things that matter most to them&#8212;such as health, family and leisure time.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Millennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous
            feedback and coaching and that&#8217;s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore, capitalize on the
            opportunity to mentor them. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY, the purpose behind how work gets done
            every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them, encourage them, inspire and motivate them,
            and challenge them to greatness. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young
            fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise
            invest in those who need and desperately want to
            grow? Sounds like a win-win. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#4.&amp;nbsp;Millennials live their ideals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to Jean Case, Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation, Millennials invest in the things
            they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy
            than in previous years, and put an emphasis on
            CSR in the workplace.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A common adage in leadership is to &#8220;walk the talk&#8221;. Well, Millennials are doing just
            that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on, or better yet, follow suit. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that
            leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in
            organizations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#5. Millennials number 73 million&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;p&gt;Millennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America&#8217;s largest generation in 2019, with
            73 million individuals. In fact, as of 2017, Millennials were already the largest population in the
            workforce&#8212;with 56 million working or looking for
            work.
            &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#6.&amp;nbsp;Millennials are the future (like it or not)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Padraig Cotter points out &#8220;Millennials are redesigning the future of work. They&#8217;re
            digital natives and it&#8217;s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it&#8217;s about&amp;nbsp;
            the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking
            are crucial, and Millennials can provide this.&#8221;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, fear holds us back &#8211; fear of the unknown, fear of change or just blind fear. But
            there&#8217;s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make
            their mark on the world. Let&#8217;s not succumb
            to fear and judgment just because we don&#8217;t know or understand them. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Millennials and contact centers are a perfect match. Get behind Millennials, invest in them, and
            support them as they take you to places you&#8217;ve never gone before! Read the proven ways to recruit and

        <description>It all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a
            gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of
            market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review.
            Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S.
            and Canada, representing more than&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39
            million residential accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Of those,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44
            percent receive services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;from a retail energy
            provider (REP), as of year-end 2014.
            &amp;nbsp;
            Although the legislative environment is still very much in flux, utility companies increasingly recognize
            the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product
            or service, new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the
            consumer relationship.
            &amp;nbsp;
            In this highly controlled industry, demand from utility providers, REPs and consumers to provide more
            immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction
            with consumers. Currently, Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to
            communication&#8212;specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues
            related to service and payments can be conducted.&#173;&#173; As a result, many companies have moved to
            un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified
            operation for three key reasons: &lt;strong&gt;Consistency, Focus on Customer Experience, and Improved
            Revenue Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;.
            &amp;nbsp;
            Alorica, a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector, has introduced Financial Care
            (through its subsidiary, EGS Financial Care, Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the
            industry that focuses on Care, First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help
            Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation, who prefer Web-based self-service
            options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid
            energy).
            &amp;nbsp;
            As they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels, utility regulators and electricity
            providers should consider the following market trends:
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumers are increasingly mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;Smartphone technology and
            cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere, anytime &#8211;
            everything from turning devices on and off, to re-programming their thermostat settings, to making a
            payment. And as technology continues to advance, consumers will look for further innovation from utility
            providers related to mobile platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumers want more control over costs.&lt;/strong&gt;The idea of prepaid electric
            service &#8211; based on previous consumption rates &#8211; has already gained traction with consumers who
            are now seeing &lt;a
            href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;energy
            savings between 5.5 and 14 percent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;However, this
            model brings with it new challenges; specifically, protecting customers who may underestimate their usage,
            particularly because&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;utility
            companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart meters mean more programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Smart meters, which measure
            energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes, have opened up opportunities for time-based rate
            programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a
            href="https://www.smartgrid.gov/recovery_act/time_based_rate_programs.html"&gt;consumers can benefit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;from
            the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates.&amp;nbsp;Energy
            companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively
            and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings.&lt;/li&gt;
            &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            New developments in technology, combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices, means
            that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences, or be left behind with antiquated systems
            and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly
            tools, electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the
            opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further
            positive change for the industry as a whole.
            &amp;nbsp;
            When you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change,
            many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced
            customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience, resources and
            PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house
            Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions&#8212;eliminating significant capital expense,
            time delay and HR challenges.
            &amp;nbsp;
            Through outsourcing, Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience
            and satisfaction ratings. Talk about a brighter outlook for everyone.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating Solid Foundations with Knowledge Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; Having a centralized digital foundation to help customers and agents makes both dollars and sense.
            And without one, you&#8217;re stuck with customer complaints, agents scrambling for the right answers, high
            agent turnover and lengthy agent training efforts, and process inefficiencies that hamper growth and harm
            your bottom line. Alorica&#8217;s Knowledge Management solution improves customer and agent outcomes,
            reduces overhead costs and increases operational efficiency&#8212;for the life of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Smarter Way to Support Your Agents and Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; Did you know that virtual agents conduct only 10% of customer interactions?&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
            Even when 40% of customers report experiencing higher call volumes that trained agents couldn&#8217;t
            control? Agents spend an average of 19% of their time searching for answers&#8212;online and asking their
            colleagues for help.&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;With Alorica&#8217;s Knowledge Management as your digital
            foundation, you can harness the power of technology to create more consistent and efficient customer
            experiences&#8212;and give your agents the support they need to deliver consistently great CX. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user
            growth. From discounts &amp;amp; online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers,
            and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns
            that entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One
            underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building&#8212;and brand loyalty&#8212;is
            customer support, which has taken
            on greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a
            href="https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;current gaming boom&lt;/a&gt; is not exactly unique. The industry has
            seen explosive
            growth in the past, with &lt;a
            href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/the-8-generations-of-video-game-consoles/zvcjkty" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;eight generations of consoles&lt;/a&gt; recruiting a whole new crop
            of hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the
            ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the
            conveniences provided by app-based food delivery
            ordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media.
            They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a
            result, a comprehensive player support
            strategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer
            experience (CX) operation. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-Inclusive Player Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the
            internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech
            support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that
            took shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service,
            as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern
            CX team is required to offer grew
            by the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics, such as account management &amp;amp; payment
            processing, plus community moderation, knowledge management expansion, live events support, and protecting
            gamers against fraud. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Then there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe, so video game
            companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every
            time zone. Even better, support agents should have
            the regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global
            gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down, gaming companies need to adopt robust CX
            services now or risk losing players
            to the companies that do. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Loyalty Outside the Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regardless of industry, &lt;a
            href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;market data consistently demonstrates&lt;/a&gt; that
            positive customer experiences are a major competitive differentiator. The challenge is that customer
            experiences in 2021 look a lot different than they did a decade ago. For starters, consumers have
            dramatically changed the way they communicate
            with one another. Millennials and Generation Z have jumpstarted this shift. These digital natives &lt;a
            href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/summary.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;overwhelmingly prefer&lt;/a&gt; to communicate via
            digital messaging tools as opposed to traditional channels &#8211; and this appears to apply whether they
            are engaging their best friends &lt;a
            href="https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/NRF_GenZ%20Brand%20Relationships%20Exec%20Report.pdf"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;or their favorite brands&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the
            younger generations are more comfortable with digital channels, whether they are powered by humans or bots.
            &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also follows the logic that Generation Z is &lt;a
            href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AI_chatbot.GBM_.pdf" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;more open&lt;/a&gt; to using AI-powered chatbots because
            they have experience with AI applications from the games they grew up with. Deploying virtual assistants
            makes it easier for tech-savvy consumers to engage brands while supplying contact centers the extra
            bandwidth to resolve any number of issues.
            The point is to give consumers choice. Introducing omnichannel functionality through voice and text-based
            capabilities enables support teams to meet players through their favorite channels, creating positive
            impressions in the process. The number
            one goal of every developer and publisher should be that players are spending their time on game play and
            not support issues. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating Trust and Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As gaming companies continue to develop multiple revenue streams, the risk and volume of fraud, not
            to mention account abuse, are sure to increase. The average player today is more likely to engage brands
            outside the game, whether that&#8217;s consuming
            YouTube reviews, Twitch live streams, podcast recordings, message boards, and the targeted journalism
            devoted to gaming. The abundance of media today has seeped into the mainstream, exposing players to content
            that was traditionally only seen or heard
            by the most serious of fans. And with consumers having a heightened awareness of privacy and security, video
            game companies must protect players efficiently and responsively from fraud across all channels. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies that provide reliable, safe environments are more likely to realize player community
            growth.&amp;nbsp; As consumer behavior and expectations change, so too must player support. As much as game
            developers, publishers, and cloud platforms prioritize
            developing the coolest, most popular games, they also need to place emphasis on offering a modern,
            comprehensive customer journey that makes it easy for players to simply focus on playing their next game.
            Only then will they foster loyalty and expand
            their user base. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

            services are more accessible&#8212;especially in the wake of COVID-19. In the U.S., the passage of the

            Medicare recipients to access telehealth services through 2024.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol

            With the age of online medicine and distributed care in full swing, healthcare systems are competing with
            retail clinics, big tech, digital healthtech startups, and payers. And considering that 60% of consumers
            expect their digital healthcare experiences to mirror retail&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a

            hard not to smile while having a conversation with &lt;b&gt;Albertha Turner&lt;/b&gt;&#8212;not only because
            of her sunny and curious personality, but also because she so obviously cares for others. To her, being a
            mentor is an integral part
            of her daily life. You know the concept of &#8220;paying it forward&#8221;? Well, that describes Albertha to
            the T. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though you could say that &lt;b&gt;Albertha &lt;/b&gt;fell into
            the training and development field, it&#8217;s no accident that led her to her current role as &lt;b&gt;VP,
            Operations Training&lt;/b&gt; at Alorica. She&#8217;s someone who truly enjoys
            teaching people and seeing them succeed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Read her full Q&amp;amp;A below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font
            color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your
            career?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;My strategy has been to always keep in touch
            with the company&#8217;s goals and initiatives.
            If we&#8217;re not aligned, we&#8217;re not anything. I learned years ago that the purpose of training is to
            achieve a business result, and you can only achieve that when you know the goals. I&#8217;ve done this
            throughout my career. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Did you ever work
            with a mentor, and how did that process help you? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I
            like to say that I&#8217;ve had many mentors, even though they may not have known. If I see someone who has
            a talent, trait or skill that I admire, I&#8217;m going to get to know them. I will insert myself in their
            space and ask them to teach me. As you supervise people, you should be their teacher and guide. If I know
            something, I&#8217;m going to share
            it with you and my team. There&#8217;s no value in holding back information. The more we all know, the more
            we can be successful together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Can you
            think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? How did you face that
            challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;As I look at challenges that I&#8217;ve
            had, I try to not
            look at it from the perspective of, &#8220;are you challenging me because I&#8217;m a female or a different
            race?&#8221; What I do is if someone is challenging me, or doesn&#8217;t want to work with me, I find out
            why. You&#8217;re going to work with
            all different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things. What are you going
            to do? You have to work through each issue. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: How has working at Alorica specifically led to
            your personal career growth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;At Alorica, this Women&#8217;s
            Initiative is very exciting. It&#8217;s wonderful that the company has
            taken this opportunity to say we need to do more, we need to help to educate and grow our female work force.
            In my area, I find the training field exciting. Even though I fell into this position, it was definitely a
            great fit for me. It fit my natural
            tendencies which is to want to see people succeed. In training, you get the satisfaction of seeing someone
            on the operations floor being successful. I love investing in each person. &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#98521c"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: How important is it to have a career plan? How
            often do you outline your personal career goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I
            look at where I am, generally in December or January. I&#8217;m a linear person,
            and I do things in a timeline. I look back at the goals I made last year. Did I meet them, how close did I
            get, and should I realign them? I do checks along the way to make sure I&#8217;m on track throughout the
            year. There are times when life happens,
            personal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course. Then, you have to look at your
            original goal and ask if that&#8217;s the right one to have. A goal is just that&#8212;it&#8217;s a point of
            direction, but you have to be flexible
            enough to take detours. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Focusing on sustainability is a responsibility that we all share as individuals, groups,
            businesses and communities. At Alorica, our approach to protecting the planet as part of our Corporate
            Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social &amp;amp;
            Governance (ESG) is no different than how we advance our philanthropic and people-centered programs&#8212;we
            stay &lt;i&gt;connected&lt;/i&gt; with the needs and interests of our employees and then we &lt;i&gt;empower
            &lt;/i&gt;each other to make a difference where it matters
            most. The key is to get started from wherever you can in as many different ways as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
            a large employer in the people business, it&#8217;s important that Alorica leads initiatives to positively
            impact the countries in which we operate. We focus on maintaining sustainable operations across our
            large-scale contact centers, whether it&#8217;s
            by partnering with vendors that are sustainability experts in managing and recycling waste or making
            environmentally conscious changes to our offices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

            of a GREENGUARD-certified Healthy High-Performance Cleaning (HHPC) program to use green, earth-friendly
            cleaning products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENERGY STAR certification by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
            at our sites (and counting!), meaning that these buildings use less energy and cause fewer greenhouse gas
            emissions than their peers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Significant reduction of our carbon footprint by cutting down
            employees&#8217; commute and usage of environment-impacting office protocols through our work-at-home
            program&#8212;Alorica Anywhere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracking and reporting of our ESG efforts through
            participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which enables us to achieve our sustainability
            goals and align closely with our clients&#8217; objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
            there&#8217;s something else businesses can do. What we&#8217;ve learned at Alorica is that educating and
            encouraging our 115,000+ employees to also do their part makes a huge difference. Our people are passionate
            and they make things happen! Last
            year, we had nearly 44,000 employees complete our annual Sustainability Survey! Out of these participants&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul
            style="margin-left: 60px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;81% of Aloricans shared that they commuted to work sustainably
            (biking, walking, carpooling)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;86% used energy-efficient light bulbs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;90%
            of employees consciously didn&#8217;t print (paper) regularly for work &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not
            only that, but our employees chose eco-friendly projects as their teambuilding activities and as part of our
            &lt;i&gt;2022 Passion for the Planet&lt;/i&gt; contest, which led to &lt;b&gt;1,588 trees being planted and
            188,000 pounds of material being recycled.&lt;/b&gt; We
            continue to measure and recognize these initiatives as well as share tips and key facts to remind our
            workforce that every environment-focused action counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So,
            let&#8217;s continue to be intentional together. Whether it&#8217;s using your own reusable water bottle,
            turning off lights and water when not in use, or being conscious of how much plastic/packaging is being used
            when you shop&#8212;our efforts
            matter. Remember, Earth is all we have. There is no Plan(et) B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Alorica&#8217;s Trust &amp;amp; Safety Service Can Help&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
            am thrilled to be heading up Alorica&#8217;s global &lt;a href="/outcomes/community/trust-and-safety"&gt;Trust
            &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/a&gt; service line&#8212;a critical area that makes a tremendous impact in promoting
            and protecting brands and their customers, but also our online communities. Maintaining accurate and
            helpful information is vital in a quickly changing digital landscape where we are all constantly bombarded
            with content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mitigating risks, companies cannot sit on the sidelines.
            They must act&#8212;and act fast&#8212;or they will face serious consequences as a brand&#8217;s value is
            closely tied to its reputation. The loss of customer confidence directly
            impacts profit margins and customer loyalty.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having led diverse functions
            across the CX industry for over 30 years&#8212;Operations, HR, Recruiting, Sales&#8212;I have seen companies
            benefit greatly from having a proactive reputation management strategy in place. A well-managed reputation
            can increase
            the overall value of your brand, making it more attractive to customers, talent, investors, and potential
            partners, and it can also help your company avert risk before it escalates into a major crisis.&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, your reputation strategy can make or break your brand, and here is why
            you need an experienced and scalable CX partner like Alorica to manage your Trust &amp;amp; Safety services:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul
            style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Team You Can Trust:&lt;/b&gt; We leverage over 20 years of
            experience across highly sensitive and regulated industries, creating environments where customers feel safe

            people, processes, and technologies with fresh, out-of-the-box approaches to shield your customers from
