As one of the largest business process outsourcers (BPO) globally with 100,000 employees across 17 countries and 24 years of CX experience—Alorica continues to scale and diversify its best-in-class workforce, now with a presence in these new markets. Setting up operations in Egypt and Poland further enables the digital CX company to meet the growing expectations of multinational companies to deliver industry-leading business outcomes including multilingual customer care, revenue generation, content management & content moderation, tech support and CX consulting. Alorica plans to open for business in both countries during second quarter of this year. “Growth through Africa and Europe is key to our strategy of offering culturally and linguistically relevant support to well-established and emerging businesses worldwide,” said Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer at Alorica. “Egypt and Poland have been on our radar as robust commercial markets with a strong talent pipeline. Our new operations will unlock career opportunities for local residents and create a distinct path to extend our solutions to clients in the region.” With the expansion into Egypt and Poland, Alorica continues its investment into high-growth markets with scalable talent. Its experienced workforce offers CX support in over 30 languages to service brands in high-demand industries ranging from financial services, technology, travel & hospitality to e-commerce and retail among others. With existing operations of 1,000+ employees in Sofia, Bulgaria, the company will continue to leverage its innovative technologies to engage employees and customers through a combination of its work-at-home and on-site programs. In Cairo, Alorica’s new contact center is strategically located in Sheikh Zayed City near top private universities, while its site in Łódź, Poland is in the heart of the city near Warsaw—accessible to high-caliber candidates. Both locations are equipped with numerous onsite amenities—accessible transportation, public services, retail stores, and more—while providing maximum efficiency for both brick-and-mortar and work-at-home operations that appeals to a multicultural and multilingual workforce.

 announced today that its Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee and non-profit partner <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a>(MLBA), have been named a Silver winner in the 18th annual Stevie® Awards
    for Women in Business, recognized for “Most Valuable Non-Profit Response”. Lee was honored for leading MLBA’s efforts to provide pandemic relief through a culture of connection and empowerment, spanning grant donations, charity support
    and resource assistance. &nbsp;

</p><p>“Alorica’s program was a standout among this year’s entries, demonstrating tremendous work and support for those impacted by the pandemic,” said Maggie Gallagher Miller, President of the Stevie® Awards. “This campaign
    not only reached a large number of people, but empowered Alorica’s staff to make a true difference in their communities. Making Lives Better with Alorica is a remarkable endeavor to be encouraged.” &nbsp;
</p><p>As the Founder and President of MLBA—a nonprofit led by Alorica employees—Lee initiated COVID-19 relief efforts to help recipients with essential needs, such as rent, water and utilities to prevent homelessness as well as to cover costs for
    medical care, groceries, sanitary supplies and funeral expenses for those who tragically lost loved ones. In 2020, the nonprofit raised nearly $867,000 in monetary donations, awarded 924 grants totaling $527,000, assisted 400+ families through crisis
    relief efforts, and supported 68 charities globally. &nbsp;
</p><p>MLBA was also recognized for directly supporting a number of charities and organizations in the fight against COVID-19. This includes WeNeedMasks.org to combat supply shortages of PPE; Catchafire, where Aloricans could virtually volunteer with other nonprofits;
    the Red Cross to attract volunteers to donate blood; and Second Harvest Food Bank to host food distributions, <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/charities-and-organizations-helping-to-fight-covid-19/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">among other organizations</a>.
 Additionally, Lee led the charge in organizing an online information center for resources to help those in need take care of themselves, their families and their communities. This portal included federal, state, local and Alorica corporate assistance
    for necessities like food, utilities, unemployment benefits and healthcare. &nbsp;

</p><p>“People turn to MLBA when they have nowhere else to go for help and unfortunately the pandemic became one of those situations for many people around the world,” shared Lee. “I’m grateful that Alorica and MLBA were able to play

</p>&nbsp;     &nbsp; &nbsp;","Spearheaded by CCO Joyce Lee, Making Lives Better with Alorica Distinguished for Grant Funding, Charity Collaboration and Resource Coordination IRVINE, Calif – Oct. 7, 2021 — Alorica Inc. , a global leader in digital customer experience (CX) solutions , announced today that its Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee and non-profit partner Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA), have been named a Silver winner in the 18th annual Stevie® Awards for Women in Business, recognized for “Most Valuable Non-Profit Response”. Lee was honored for leading MLBA’s efforts to provide pandemic relief through a culture of connection and empowerment, spanning grant donations, charity support and resource assistance. “Alorica’s program was a standout among this year’s entries, demonstrating tremendous work and support for those impacted by the pandemic,” said Maggie Gallagher Miller, President of the Stevie® Awards. “This campaign not only reached a large number of people, but empowered Alorica’s staff to make a true difference in their communities. Making Lives Better with Alorica is a remarkable endeavor to be encouraged.” As the Founder and President of MLBA—a nonprofit led by Alorica employees—Lee initiated COVID-19 relief efforts to help recipients with essential needs, such as rent, water and utilities to prevent homelessness as well as to cover costs for medical care, groceries, sanitary supplies and funeral expenses for those who tragically lost loved ones. In 2020, the nonprofit raised nearly $867,000 in monetary donations, awarded 924 grants totaling $527,000, assisted 400+ families through crisis relief efforts, and supported 68 charities globally. MLBA was also recognized for directly supporting a number of charities and organizations in the fight against COVID-19. This includes WeNeedMasks.org to combat supply shortages of PPE; Catchafire, where Aloricans could virtually volunteer with other nonprofits; the Red Cross to attract volunteers to donate blood; and Second Harvest Food Bank to host food distributions, among other organizations . Additionally, Lee led the charge in organizing an online information center for resources to help those in need take care of themselves, their families and their communities. This portal included federal, state, local and Alorica corporate assistance for necessities like food, utilities, unemployment benefits and healthcare. “People turn to MLBA when they have nowhere else to go for help and unfortunately the pandemic became one of those situations for many people around the world,” shared Lee. “I’m grateful that Alorica and MLBA were able to play a role in providing essential funds, critical resources and hope during these times. I’m constantly inspired and in awe of people’s generosity, kindness, creativity and humanity especially when it matters most. This award is a recognition to all the #MLBAHeroes who contributed to make a difference.” The Stevie® Awards for Women in Business honor women executives, entrepreneurs, employees, and the companies they run—worldwide.

Alorica was recognized as a Leader for both completeness of vision and ability to execute. “We are honored to be recognized as an industry leader, and in our opinion, attribute it to our forward-thinking business strategy and operational excellence,” said Andy Lee, CEO of Alorica. “Starting off with a clear vision is critical, and without the right execution, that vision becomes impossible to achieve. Coming out of an epic year that accelerated adoption of transformative service models, we will continue to invest in optimizing our best-in-class teams and solutions to ensure consistent delivery of unparalleled employee and customer experiences.” Alorica’s mission of creating insanely great customer experiences is driven by expanding and upskilling its workforce, deploying advanced digitization strategies and executing award-winning processes to deliver on behalf of global brands. The company leverages its expertise in talent management, globally-scaled operations and integration of machine learning, big data and automation to empower its employees. As a technology integrator, Alorica provides clients with flexible deployment models in the development of digital and operational solutions. As a result of Alorica’s unwavering vision and execution, the leading BPO has captured key CX opportunities in both traditional and emerging services including content moderation , concierge services, gaming support and fraud programs. For Ability to Execute, Alorica was positioned the highest, which according to Gartner, “summarizes factors such as the vendor’s financial viability, market responsiveness, product development, sales channels and customer base.” Lee added, “Our valued partners are facing a time of rapid transformation, and our unique approach to engagement provides strategic, operational and financial alignment with their business needs. As one of the world’s largest customer experience providers, we have the global scale, high-performance track record, industry-leading talent and innovative service offerings to deliver differentiated service experiences to our clients.” Gartner is one of the world’s leading research & advisory firms and the Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. BPOs were evaluated based on 15 criteria including customer experience, market strategy, product/service, operations and innovation among others. The research enables companies to get the most from market analysis in alignment with their unique business and technology needs.

Clifton assumes responsibility for the company’s global information technology (IT) organization and initiatives, overseeing the design and delivery of digital technologies and strategies for Alorica’s continued success. “Mike is a proven leader in digitization with a passion for innovation and creating solutions that drive results for clients,” said Andy Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Alorica. “With a breadth of experience across IT, operations and sales, he will play a key role in advancing Alorica’s mission to transform the next generation of omnichannel customer experiences.” Clifton has over 30 years of experience in software, technology, operations and sales, having held CIO and CISO titles at numerous companies. He joins Alorica from Cognizant, one of the world’s leading professional services companies, where he served as both CIO and Chief Innovation Technology Officer. In these roles, Clifton led global IT, operations and data, in which he oversaw the design and implementation of digitization strategies, IT organizational models, new market growth, and service-level management. Prior to Cognizant, Clifton held C-level positions at Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Hanover Insurance Group, Nobilis Software and others. “If customer loyalty reflects a brand’s health, then CX management is the lifeblood of every corporate enterprise,” commented Clifton. “Alorica is known for innovating digital-first CX strategies and modernizing the customer journey across industries. As the company continues to expand, I could not be more thrilled to join the team.” Clifton succeeds outgoing Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer Steve Phillips, who joined Alorica in 2018. Phillips brought a combination of strategic technology leadership and operational discipline during his time with the company and led the transformation of Alorica’s IT organization into a strategic asset for both the company and its clients. “Under Steve’s leadership, Alorica made significant progress enhancing our security posture, aligning our business and clients’ interests, and bringing forward new technology solutions that matter to our clients,” added Lee. “We are grateful for his many contributions and wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.” “It has been an honor to lead Alorica’s IT organization for the last three years,” said Phillips. “Alorica is dedicated to delivering world-class CX solutions and it’s been inspiring to see the progress made by the Alorica team over the last few years to advance our IT platforms to deliver against that mission. Mike is the ideal successor to continue that advancement.” About Alorica Alorica is a trusted global leader in customer experience solutions.

It enables CX service professionals to choose an accent that best removes friction in real time, while preserving the speaker’s authenticity, an experience that beta users and investors have described as “magical.” Customers want to clearly and easily understand the communication from contact centers and Sanas’ technology will place Alorica at the forefront of that pursuit.</p>
<p>“Linguistic translation allows us to focus on providing the best service experiences in real time regardless of native dialects that can result in confusion or bias,” said Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer of Alorica. “Collaborating with Sanas will allow us to deploy this innovative technology throughout our entire infrastructure in a way that lets our CX team members do what they do best – provide industry-leading service without barriers.”</p>
<p>“The goal of Sanas has always been to bring people closer together and allow them to have choices when it comes to their communication styles – something that was previously only possible through extensive speech language pathology,” said Maxim Serebryakov, Chief Executive Officer of Sanas. “Similar to how consumers would experience service from a local service center, Sanas’ technology brings that local comprehension to consumers from anywhere in the world,” added Sharath Keshava, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Sanas.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership positions Alorica and its clients with first-to-market, exclusive access to the technology and an advisory position with Sanas’ leadership as part of a joint investment in the future of linguistic AI. Servicing over 250 clients across 16 countries in over 30 languages, Alorica specializes in integrating technologies that empower a global workforce to deliver differentiated service experiences.</p>

It enables CX service professionals to choose an accent that best removes friction in real time, while preserving the speaker’s authenticity, an experience that beta users and investors have described as “magical.” Customers want to clearly and easily understand the communication from contact centers and Sanas’ technology will place Alorica at the forefront of that pursuit. “Linguistic translation allows us to focus on providing the best service experiences in real time regardless of native dialects that can result in confusion or bias,” said Greg Haller, Chief Executive Officer of Alorica. “Collaborating with Sanas will allow us to deploy this innovative technology throughout our entire infrastructure in a way that lets our CX team members do what they do best – provide industry-leading service without barriers.” “The goal of Sanas has always been to bring people closer together and allow them to have choices when it comes to their communication styles – something that was previously only possible through extensive speech language pathology,” said Maxim Serebryakov, Chief Executive Officer of Sanas. “Similar to how consumers would experience service from a local service center, Sanas’ technology brings that local comprehension to consumers from anywhere in the world,” added Sharath Keshava, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Sanas. The strategic partnership positions Alorica and its clients with first-to-market, exclusive access to the technology and an advisory position with Sanas’ leadership as part of a joint investment in the future of linguistic AI. Servicing over 250 clients across 16 countries in over 30 languages, Alorica specializes in integrating technologies that empower a global workforce to deliver differentiated service experiences. “Our mission is to provide personalized service and support experiences to clients’ end customers across every industry and geography we serve,” said Andy Lee, Founder and Executive Chairman of Alorica. “As a leader in orchestrating technology and talent to provide strategic outcomes to clients, we continue to invest in solutions that remove friction and enhance the overall quality and execution of that experience.” A leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Customer Service Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), Alorica’s strategic partnership with Sanas aligns with the company’s mission to open new global market opportunities and remove bias from the delivery of insanely great customer experiences.

    “Inclusiveness has always been a part of Alorica’s DNA. This award is a testament to the remarkable work our employees are leading through our TIDE program, which celebrates, supports and empowers diverse voices around the globe, and in

Based on the sentiment of employees of color who anonymously rated Alorica during a 12-month period (July 2020 – June 2021), this award recognizes the Company for driving positive culture change and encouraging diversity and inclusion across the organization. “With nearly 70% of our U.S. workforce comprised of minorities, I am incredibly proud of the impact we are making within our Alorica family and also in the communities in which we operate,” said Andy Lee, Chairman and CEO of Alorica. “Inclusiveness has always been a part of Alorica’s DNA. This award is a testament to the remarkable work our employees are leading through our TIDE program, which celebrates, supports and empowers diverse voices around the globe, and in turn, builds a stronger sense of unity. I share this recognition with every employee at Alorica who helps us build a work culture that is accepting, kind and encouraging.” In 2020, Alorica launched TIDE , a grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiative as part of its global Corporate Social Responsibility program. Now an integral component of the employee experience, TIDE’s ongoing Real Talk series provides employees at all levels with an interactive forum to increase awareness, share experiences and develop solutions to social issues within their communities. Since its inception, Alorica’s TIDE teams have facilitated over 70 Real Talk sessions around the world. ""This past year shined a vital spotlight on racial inequities,"" said Comparably CEO Jason Nazar. “Our annual Best CEOs for Diversity recognizes the leaders that employees of color have deemed as top-notch. This year's list is no exception with an incredible group of chief executives, like Alorica's Andy Lee, that have shown strong leadership through the pandemic and a commitment to DE+I in their organizations."" Alorica is the world’s largest minority-owned business process outsourcing (BPO) provider and certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by both the National Minority Supplier Development Council and Southern California Minority Supplier Development Council. Comparably’s Best CEOs for Diversity Award is among several accolades Alorica has received since last year, including the 2021 Stevie Award which recognized Alorica for Minority-Owned Business of the Year . The company was also distinguished as an Impact Sourcing Champion by IAOP in July 2020 for strategically hiring thousands of employees around the world from underserved communities. Additionally, Alorica was recognized by two of the leading industry analyst firms earlier this year—Gartner named Alorica a Leader in its 2021 Magic Quadrant for Customer Service BPO for completeness of vision and ability to execute and NelsonHall named Alorica a Leader in its 2021 Social Media CX Services NEAT Assessment for Content Moderation, Trust and Safety.

To manage the influx of these programs along with the company’s overall growth this year,

</p><p>Through its pandemic-proof platform, Alorica helps clients promote and protect their brands’ digital presence by managing and moderating their social media engagement, online communities and forums, business listings and customer reviews, advertisements,
    search engine rankings and more. Currently supporting over 30 countries in more than 15 languages, Alorica handles nearly a billion social CX transactions per year. This work is done on behalf of the largest companies in the world across key industries,
    such as digital entertainment and social media networks, ecommerce and online marketplaces, software and consumer electronics, online banking and on-demand delivery apps. Additionally, thousands of Alorica’s problem-solving global team members
    handle content moderation to safeguard brands and online communities from abusive content. &nbsp;
</p><p>“In a feedback economy where brand reputation is defined by public opinion, Alorica helps companies engage, be discovered and recommended online,” said Chris Crowley, Alorica’s Chief Commercial Officer. “We help increase impressions,
    engagement and ultimately spend on behalf of our clients. For social media customer care alone, we manage more than 54 million interactions annually.” &nbsp;
</p><p>During COVID-19 where online activities like shopping, live streaming and social networking have become more prevalent, associated risks have also increased with alarming speed. According to Sift’s Q2 2020 Digital Trust &amp; Safety Index, in the
    first half of 2020, online marketplaces were hit with a 109% increase in attempted identity theft with nearly half of it being financially motivated scams. Utilizing leading fraud prevention systems for the past 10 years, Alorica delivers solutions
    for identity &amp; credit monitoring as well as detection of account takeovers, fraud and data breaches—resolving over 2 million fraud cases annually for online customers. &nbsp;
</p><p>“Our job is not only to protect our clients’ brand equity and their customers’ trust, but also to keep the internet safe. As digital interactions continue to grow at a tremendous rate, this responsibility becomes even more important,
    explained Crowley. “Based on our ability to deliver on the overwhelming need so far this year, we have experienced 128% growth in managing these social CX programs, and we’re looking forward to seven-fold growth in this space by 2022.”

<p><strong>Alorica</strong>, compañía global líder especializada en experiencia del cliente, abrió las puertas de su nuevo Centro de Conexión en&nbsp;<strong>Boca del Río, Veracruz</strong>, junto con el ha iniciado esfuerzos de reclutamiento para cubrir de forma inmediata&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline"">300 puestos presenciales y de trabajo remoto</span>, parte de un&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline"">total de 600 plazas a lo largo de 2022</span>.</p>
<p>Este&nbsp;<strong>Centro de Conexión</strong>&nbsp;forma parte de una red global de centros similares diseñados para complementar las herramientas tecnológicas de Alorica para el trabajo remoto y brindar a sus colaboradores apoyo en temas de reclutamiento, soporte de sistemas y diversas actividades de cultura organizacional.</p>
<p>Durante la rueda de prensa,&nbsp;<strong>José Ramírez</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Presidente de Alorica Latinoamérica y el Caribe,</strong>&nbsp;mencionó que la compañía se dedica a la subcontratación de procesos comerciales; lo que actualmente se conoce como&nbsp;<em>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO),&nbsp;</em>por sus siglas en inglés. </p>
<p>Señaló que este nuevo&nbsp;<strong>Centro de Conexión</strong>&nbsp;es la prueba del compromiso de Alorica con Veracruz, donde actualmente se cuenta con 300 personas haciendo teletrabajo. Según sus pronósticos, se contratarán a unas 600 personas en los próximos meses y de 2 mil a 3 mil en los próximos dos años.</p>
<em>“Nosotros&nbsp;<strong>exportamos servicios hacia Estados Unidos</strong>. Por ende, todo el dinero que se genera de nuestros clientes procede de aquel país y se inyecta en la ciudad”.&nbsp;Es decir, “se queda en salarios, impuestos, servicios básicos, en la renta de esta oficina y la que tendremos en la periferia de la ciudad, porque vamos a seguir abriendo oficinas pequeñas e, incluso, estamos explorando la apertura de una sexta oficina en la Ciudad de México; como parte de nuestros planes de crecimiento en el país”,&nbsp;reveló. <br>

We implemented an innovative learning analytics solution, designed to root out agent
training problems at the source. &nbsp;

</p>
<h4><strong>DATA SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE!</strong></h4>
<p>Speed-to-proficiency—the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully serve their customers—is a driving Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for companies looking to streamline operations. One such company—a worldwide
telecom provider—was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business.
</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>To implement an innovative learning analytics solution—designed to root out agent training problems at the source</li>
    <br>
    <li>Run a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE OUTCOME </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Eradication of agent struggles—impacting new-hire trainee proficiency</li>
    <br>
    <li>5% reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 days</li>
    <br>
    <li>6-day reduction of new-hire training time</li>
    <br>
    <li>80% knowledge retention after 1 year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong> <br>
An Empowered Agent Starts with Better Training. Traditionally, the client’s agent training program was lengthy and costly—not to mention that agents weren’t consistently retaining all of the needed
information to resolve customer billing inquiries. Enter Alorica. Our Training and Quality teams took a look at the situation and asked—how can we shorten the training process, while still helping agents retain knowledge? Faster and better—it’s
not an easy code to crack! But then again, they don’t call us for the easy ones.
</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
<br>
A New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing ‘confidently-held misinformation’ by using an industry-leading learning analytics technology
platform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period, confidently-held misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn, this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention, and thus the
ability to better navigate customer billing queries.
</p>
<p>In short, we were able to identify a problem the client didn’t even know they had—and then offer a solution that would totally change the game.</p>
<p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong>
<br>
We’re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful, the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business. Furthermore, we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents, who appreciated a novel, innovative
and interesting approach to their training.
</p>
<p>Overall, the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency, observed a decrease in risk and loss, and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction—all of which led to happier agents, happier customers and a happier client.</p>

</p><ol><li><strong>Volume Data –</strong> Contact events are signs that something isn’t easy for customers to solve on their own. Knowing why customers contact you, by what channels, and with what frequency is key to understanding what the customer
        wants and where the stumbling blocks are. Look at average handle times, rates of repeat contacts, escalations and transfers to determine where there are breakdowns in the contact experience – these are the elements that may be negatively

We call this new approach microlearning—short, interactive, 2-10
    minute videos that deliver information “just in time”—right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional “just in case” classroom learning, Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and
    help reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>In action:</strong> Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)—leading to significant

</p><p>Turning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning— that’s gamification. Through it, employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance,
    see how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards. &nbsp;
</p><p>We customize our systems to each client’s individual objective, and drive agent effort from “acceptable” to “optimal” performanc with game played and reward earned. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>In action:</strong> Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance, attrition, absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It’s simple—engaged employees, who receive a boost in recognition and
    incentives, perform better. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>ROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)</strong> &nbsp;
</p><p>Movies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity, but they’re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster, reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant.
    &nbsp; There are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view, allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA is all about workflow computerization, and
    these robots identify manual, repetitive and rules-based processes—tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent, and with complete accuracy. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>In action:</strong> For a major energy company, robotic automation reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10%, and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major telecommunications firm, robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing

</p><p>Job-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels, and we’re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to their automated nature, chatbots can handle simultaneous

Download our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better…one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica, we’re all about using disruptive using technologies in our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we’re using to change the game—and the results we’ve seen so far. MICROLEARNING 80% of our new hires are millennials—and given their average 90-second attention span, we’ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging. We call this new approach microlearning—short, interactive, 2-10 minute videos that deliver information “just in time”—right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional “just in case” classroom learning, Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and help reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions. In action: Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)—leading to significant cost savings for the client. GAMIFICATION Turning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning— that’s gamification. Through it, employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance, see how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards. We customize our systems to each client’s individual objective, and drive agent effort from “acceptable” to “optimal” performanc with game played and reward earned.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/lessons-in-loyalty","<p>While conducting research for this blog, it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective
that loyalty programs are, at their core, focused on driving revenue, but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing.</p>
<p>A recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experience.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;That’s why it’s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the
customer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point when considering the customer experience
is the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs, this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits. </p>
<p>Consider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer experience: &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep it simple and clear</h3>
<p>According to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer effort is an important part of building loyalty,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do
this, keep these points in mind: &nbsp;
</p>
<h4><strong>Simple points system</strong></h4>
<p>The most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that translate into some type of reward, and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship
between points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing.</p>
<p>One way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of points, the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However, this system typically works best for businesses that encourage frequent short-term purchases.<sup>3</sup></p>
<h4><strong>Set a clear goal, and make it easy to see progress</strong></h4>
<p>To prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program, customers must look forward to a clear-cut goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they’ll lose interest.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>A major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of their rewards point balance, and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal. Providing customers with clear and easily accessible
methods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort. &nbsp; </p>
<p>A recent JD &amp; Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President’s Club were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards programs.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Looking at their mobile apps
and how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags behind.

<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor and control</h3>
<p>An excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates retention but can also help ascertain whether your
customers feel that the program is too obtuse.</p>
<p>Redemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20%, and the average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;If
a redemption rate falls below 14%, it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for improvement. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Gathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program members, gather info continuously to ensure that
the organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort. &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use data for continuous improvement</h3>
<p>Loyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits, such as average transaction amount, most frequently purchased items, and much more.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;This data, combined with customer contact history, provides organizations with the
ammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases. If a customer purchased a product and experienced an issue, chances are that they may experience a similar issue with a similar product. Smart businesses will use this data in
concert to push proactive content to customers to reduce the likelihood of a future contact. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>Pretty simple, right? Create a program that is easy to understand and use, measure its effectiveness, and use the data available to continuously improve your customers’ experience. Seem daunting? If so, we’re here to help! &nbsp; </p>

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-to-automate-your-contact-center-without-leaving-your-employees-behind","<p>There’s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend that is gaining momentum and a strategy that’s important to explore. But, it’s also important to remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low unemployment and high competition for talent, retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don’t let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage.

&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize&nbsp;<strong>what</strong>&nbsp;you will be automating. That’s done by tuning into the&nbsp;<strong>why&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>how&nbsp;</strong>of the automation journey.

&nbsp;
</p><h5><strong>1. Make employees part of the why.</strong></h5><p>Employee engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you.

&nbsp;
</p><p>One of the primary reason’s employees leave a company is because they don’t feel valued or challenged.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;A strong foundation is built when employees not only feel valued for their skills, but also for their ability to communicate well, focus on the real issues requiring complex problem solving, and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way. Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead, it’s meant to create more opportunities for them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest.

&nbsp;
</p><h5><strong>2. Answer “What’s in it for me?”</strong></h5><p>Employees want to know what’s in it for them, especially as fears arise about what automation means for future job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process.

&nbsp;
</p><p>Make ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily and what prevents true resolution.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Ask what could be automated to improve the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/taking-a-bite-out-of-churn-one-customer-at-a-time","<p>As customers become more empowered to select goods and services that fit best into their lifestyle, it is imperative that businesses work harder to retain the customers they have. The cost of attracting new customers continues to increase, making it harder
to grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It’s widely understood that it is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one—5x more!—depending on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers/"">source</a></strong><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and
industry.&nbsp;This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score<sup style=""top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"">®</sup> movement. &nbsp; </p>
<p>So, we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do that in such a competitive environment? &nbsp; </p>
<p>Let’s break it down, shall we?
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Listen to your customers’ needs</strong></h5>
<p>Take the time to know your customers—really&nbsp;know them. Who are they? What do they really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires, what’s working and what isn’t, and how they feel
about their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys, phone marketing, exit interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums.
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Act on the data you gather</strong></h5>
<p>Change when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve. Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them. Provide alternative solutions where known issues
exist. Proactively offer something (a discount, promo item, etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to provide feedback. Furthermore, it’s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback—options should include human interaction
(phone or chat) and self-help (IVR, web or social). It’s your willingness and ability to connect with your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer—which directly impacts your ability
to retain and grow your market share.
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Respect your customers’ time</strong></h5>
<p>Each interaction you have with your customers should be natural, organic and personalized. Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists, and they are more likely to respond positively to a real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive
audience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers’ needs&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport—explain what you can and will do each step of the way.
Ask questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their business, let them get on with their
day. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely, over-solicitation of new offerings that don’t fit their needs could push them to a competitor. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Stay relevant</strong></h5>
<p>It hardly needs to be said (but we’re going to say it anyway)—it’s&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline"">critical&nbsp;</span>to understand your customers and your competition. The marketplace is constantly changing,
and what customers see, and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers or solutions become available, be
sure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid the fate of once&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/7-iconic-brands-no-longer-exist.asp"">iconic brands</a></strong><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;no
longer in existence. &nbsp; </p>
<p>So, let’s sum it up. To reduce costly customer churn, the key is to stay focused on and connected with the customers you have, listen and adapt to their feedback, respect their time and ensure your offers and solutions are competitively relevant.

My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and
beyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with

as you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my perspectives widened, my leadership and
listening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed.</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn?</b><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)""><br>A:</b> In my life and career, I’ve
had to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it’s because I’m female, a minority, my age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use effective communication, and make fact-based
recommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect.</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory?

Something that comes easily, or something that you have to work hard to achieve?</p>","Cielito Merriam , Global Client Solutions Director in Longwood, Florida, calls herself a “lifelong learner,” and credits that outlook with helping her attain her goals. The key to being a lifelong learner is to also be a lifelong listener. If you’re able to really listen, you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the status quo. Working her way up in the BPO industry, she started out as an agent and then was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering before she moved into client solutions. Each new opportunity was a result of learning as much as she could in every role, and then pursuing the next challenge. Read her full Q&A below: Q: How have mentors made a difference in your career? A: My first office job was during college and involved filing papers. My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and beyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with them, I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers. Q: Looking back, did you see yourself reaching a director role? A: Yes, I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward, but I think in life, your priorities change as you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my perspectives widened, my leadership and listening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed. Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn? A: In my life and career, I’ve had to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it’s because I’m female, a minority, my age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use effective communication, and make fact-based recommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect. Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory? Why or why not? A: I’ve made mistakes, I’ve suffered heartaches, I’ve fought hard and lost battles, but I can’t say I regret any of it. Every one of those things have been a learning experience, building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look at the business from varied perspectives has been positive and has let me make better decisions. Q: What excites you most about what you do at Alorica? A: Technology is progressing to take over tedious activities that allow people to spend their time in areas that provide more value, and to think of solutions for the future. It’s exciting, and absolutely a challenge. What’s more enriching? Something that comes easily, or something that you have to work hard to achieve?"

<p><em></em><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong><strong><br>
When the Scope Flew Out the Window, We Swooped Into Action.</strong> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>A major communications provider partnered with Alorica to create an inbound customer service program for billing and general inquiries. All was going smoothly, but two weeks prior to the end of new-hire training, the scope of work shifted. Alorica was
tasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support, in order to help reduce unnecessary service dispatches. And then, one week after the launch, the scope increased to include upselling of ancillary products/services. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Good thing we’re all about overcoming adversity &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong><strong><br>
Sometimes, You Need Reinforcements.</strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Changes to the scope required us to make significant investments in additional coaching and leadership resources.</p>
<p>• Sales-After-Service Coaches who specialize in Alorica’s solutions-based selling methodology were assigned to assist agents with selling on service calls. &nbsp; </p>
<p>• Business Intelligence Analysts were hired to review call recordings and compare time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch; the findings
were forwarded with suggested coaching methods to reduce the number of costly and unnecessary service dispatches. &nbsp; </p>
<p>• Voice of the Customer Coaches specializing in VOC solutions for detractors were assigned to work with agents having challenges with specific customer dissatisfaction categories &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>And Sometimes, You Need Added Bench Strength.</strong> <br>
It was critical to ensure that growth did not come at the expense of performance, so Alorica made bench strength investments by enhancing Leadership Development and Succession Planning.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>• <strong>Early leadership assessments</strong> of all agents helped workforce planning understand the potential bench strength available for ramps &nbsp; </p>
<p>• <strong>Financial incentives</strong> encouraged agents to enroll in Alorica’s “clear path” program for leadership development and leadership certifications &nbsp;</p>
<p>• <strong>Systematic succession planning</strong> established that managers would be eligible for promotion only when at least two of their subordinates were certified for promotion &nbsp; </p>
<p>• <strong>Peer-to-Peer “Buddy System”</strong> was founded, where each role, function and manager were paired up with a high-performing manager within the client’s internal contact centers &nbsp; </p>
<p>Alorica drove ticket quality and ultimately minimized the expense of dispatching to the client’s customers who truly required a service truck, by implementing a Ticket Quality Management group. &nbsp; </p>
<p>• We hired Ticket Quality Managers as business intelligence analysts to audit calls and systems, identify outliers and coach for improvements for non-qualified dispatches &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Pre-dispatch auditing</strong> identified Non-Qualified Dispatches prior to our client incurring the expense, by reviewing call recordings and comparing time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for
specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch<br>
<strong>Outlier identification</strong> of the individual team (and site where the non-qualified dispatch originated) was gathered and analyzed<br>
<strong>Outlier coaching</strong> was conducted to improve behaviors and avoid future non-qualified dispatches &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong><strong><br>
Being Nimble and Staying Committed—That’s how We Earn a Win. </strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p>The ability to react quickly to change played a major part in finding success with (and for) our client. Thanks to significant investment in additional coaching and leadership resources, our partnership with the client helped to: &nbsp; </p>

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/social-care-analytics-and-the-retail-customer-experience","<p>“Know your customer” has been a retail rallying cry for the past several decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers’ likely buying behaviors, they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers <em>now</em> face is how to enhance and personalize the customer experience, so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer and the brand—regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But let’s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as <em>Social Media</em>. What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV, radio and print as the preferred media source for a growing percentage of the population, and as ‘cord cutters’ continue to rise, advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services, and are being reallocated towards content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As these extensive technological changes continue, and growing consumer demand and the ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage, it’s imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock valuable consumer data, including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their experiences, and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care—the efforts of caring for customers using social media—is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers. Marketers, retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their customer journey by providing social media support, yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and quantitative value of their efforts.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retailers are being pushed into social care by engaged, social-savvy consumers who are posting questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming, with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news, is that not all social posts are created equal—they don’t all require a response. Robust listening platforms along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and effective.&nbsp;In addition, while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact, channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a customer asks a question in a channel that isn’t able to support an appropriate response. For example, if a customer asks a question on Twitter, the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry in 140 characters or less. For some context, the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise, a customer may need to share sensitive account information, thus requiring a more private, secure channel such as phone, chat or email.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Although channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered, it raises problems for measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately, there are technology platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Metrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program. Traditional social media metrics (“likes”, “followers,” etc.) are valuable, but they don’t necessarily provide insight into important areas—like the level of customer satisfaction across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your customer retention strategy.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Lastly, consider partnering with your user community. It’s a good idea to deploy YouTube customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z, YouTube can help you provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company’s overall support cost. Avenues for guided self-service, including video FAQs and tutorials, provide a path of great value for your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome—higher satisfaction levels for all customers, and a more strategic deployment of internal resources—both of which can impact your bottom and top lines.
&nbsp;

<p>Today’s retailers stand at a crossroads—evolve existing practices to meet and exceed the expectations of your customers, or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you in the marketplace.

Powered by personality, Alorica has redefined the contact center environment, offering a unique approach to its employee experience to reflect its people-first culture. Here are a few highlights: Career Progression – Working for Alorica is not just about having a job, but a purpose. In fact, many of our leaders, including site directors, VP and SVP of operations started on the frontlines as agents. We take the “your success is our success approach” for every team member, through a variety of ways in our training methodologies and mentoring, with the goal of helping employees perform at their best, define their career path and ultimately climb the ladder in the organization. Culture Committee – At each of our 130 sites around the world, a select group of employees at all levels, plan on-site events, such as dress-up days and cookouts, help oversee celebrations and contests, and gain VIP access to company news to then spread to the local Alorica population. Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) – Our approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other. Through the non-profit MLBA, Alorica empowers its employees to give to those in need within their own communities. With approximately 100 MLBA chapters around the world, employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and volunteering. Game Changer – This companywide program recognizes employees who continually deliver insanely great customer experience while bringing Alorica’s vision, mission and promise to life. The awards are given out at three levels—site, regional and organizational. A Special Kind of Leadership – As part of our commitment to enhance the employee experience, Alorica appointed Tania King as Chief Employee Experience Officer, joining Joyce Lee, the company’s Chief Culture Officer.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/mlba-fundraisers-our-worst-3-omaha-06","<em>by J. Scott Nebel, Omaha 06</em> <br>
While any fundraising event that engages, unifies and raises money is a worthy effort, fundraising is not without its failures and frustrations. So here is ...<strong><br>
Part 2</strong> (<span><a title=""MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)"" href=""mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"">click here for Part 1</a>):&nbsp;<strong><em>What Went Wrong…?</em>&nbsp; (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers)</strong></span>
<strong><br>
Flop Number&nbsp;3: Car Wash</strong> <br>
Hose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait, where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash, only we're not really washing anything, so it's more of a ""_"", which I really don't know
how to pronounce, but I'm pretty sure a ""_"" doesn't make any money! <br>
We have succeeded and failed with car washes, but failure was always a result of&nbsp;the planning and execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes:<br>
TIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule
more than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick, be pulled into emergency meetings, or get abducted by aliens (Seriously, it's been weeks. Where's Joe!) <br>
TIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President
of Corporate Suds and Towels, we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out&nbsp;how much staff you will need.
<br>
<strong>Flop Number 2: Off-Site Events</strong> <br>
Off-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work, getting the name Alorica out into the community—it's a win-win, even if you make
nothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ... <br>
TIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop.
Whether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either, but that's still marginally in the ""win"" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the <a title=""MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)"" href=""mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"">Penny War</a>...) <br>
TIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you have active engagement
across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of
a full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my
first attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!)
<br>
<strong>Number 1: Culture Kitchen</strong><em><br>
""Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?""</em> &nbsp;Yup.<em><br>
""Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?""</em>&nbsp; Yup. <br>
Pricing
is a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof
plan. <br>
TIP1: I ""math-ed"" and you can, too!&nbsp; Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing:<br>
<strong><em>2c/p<br>
</em></strong><strong><em>aka Two times the <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">C</span>ost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">P</span>articipants.&nbsp;</em></strong><br>
TIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation?&nbsp; Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back
in time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around <strong><em>25-33%</em></strong> of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees
(at least not when there is a charge... <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">FREE&nbsp;</span></em>food is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!) <br>
You'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you
try some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up … it’s easier to give change for whole dollars!<br>
<strong>To Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four ""P""s:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Plan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!)</li>
    <li>Promote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!)</li>
    <li>Party with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!)</li>
    <li>Peanut Butter! (Yeah, I really only had three ""P""s, sorry.)</li>

Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out how much staff you will need. Flop Number 2: Off-Site Events Off-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work, getting the name Alorica out into the community—it's a win-win, even if you make nothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ... TIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop. Whether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either, but that's still marginally in the ""win"" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the Penny War ...) TIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you have active engagement across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of a full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my first attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!) Number 1: Culture Kitchen ""Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?"" Yup. ""Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?"" Yup. Pricing is a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof plan. TIP1: I ""math-ed"" and you can, too! Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing: 2c/p aka Two times the C ost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of P articipants. TIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation? Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back in time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around 25-33% of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees (at least not when there is a charge... FREE food is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!) You'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you try some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up … it’s easier to give change for whole dollars! To Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four ""P""s: Plan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!) Promote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!) Party with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!) Peanut Butter! (Yeah, I really only had three ""P""s, sorry.)

As consumer demands continue to shift,&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">customer care solutions</a>&nbsp;teams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons’ needs. While these technologies create a faster, more flexible staff member,
    they also require special attention in some instances, since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure. &nbsp;
</p><p>IT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a&nbsp;<a href=""/industries"">customer relationship management technology</a>&nbsp;system, but in terms of systematic processes,
    finding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems, they’re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction, among other things. With that in mind, here are
    four tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue: &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>1. Don’t jump to conclusions:</strong>&nbsp;Assuming typically doesn’t get anyone very far, so best practice – especially in the customer service industry – is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It
    can be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business’s service center, especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before. However, the idea of
    effective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process:</strong>&nbsp;The parlance of a&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">BPO technical support</a>&nbsp;representative
 will likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It’s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The way a client describes something may
    make sense to him or her, but it very well could be the wrong way to&nbsp;describe something from a business standpoint. Alternatively, a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron, otherwise the internal
    vernacular may confuse the customer at hand. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>3. Manage issues in order of their importance:</strong>&nbsp;In a perfect world, nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team’s IT infrastructure, therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However, since the
    human element is a constant in the client services equation, there are bound to be mistakes in the process. As a result, management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively, or else the most important issues won’t get taken care
    of first. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>4. Cover all bases before taking action:</strong>&nbsp;This can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion, so it’s hard not to understand why a&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">contact center service</a>&nbsp;would want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet, it’s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts
    with the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a longer process, but it will teach reps to double-check, cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed. &nbsp;

As ad campaigns evolve to reach job seekers through social media and other non-traditional channels, our Philippines teams
have turned to chatbot recruitment automation technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified applicants and bring the right candidates in the door. &nbsp;

<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximize online recruiting channels</li>
    <br>
    <li>Candidates were being generated, but most leads were inactive</li>
    <br>
    <li>Reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE RESULTS</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In just three months, we interviewed ~3,000 candidates—versus 966 that same period the year prior</li>
    <br>
    <li>Saved more than 1,200 man-hours during a 3-month period</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cost-per-hire reduced by 84%</li>
    <br>
    <li>Online channel conversion rate 14-16%, versus traditional channels at 4-6%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Starting a Conversation by Speaking Their Language</strong> To attract the best talent, we needed to find a way to talk to our talent pool in ways they preferred—enter chatbot. We began by embedding the tech into our Philippines
Facebook page, and immediately we were handling simultaneous inquiries, providing real-time responses and conducting initial candidate screenings via Facebook Messenger. The best part? It all takes place 24/7, dramatically increasing the number of
candidates we can assess and ultimately hire. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Beyond simple introductory communication, our chatbot is able to facilitate in-depth Q&amp;A sessions with applicants; their responses are easily accessed by recruiters who can follow-up with next steps by phone, preserving candidate excitement and increasing
the likelihood of an in-person interview &nbsp;

</p>","Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) is a non-profit organization, and our approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other. Most companies handle charitable giving from the top-down—but Alorica is not like most companies. MLBA empowers Alorica employees to give to those in need within their own communities—allowing them to share the love with the people, and in the places, that matter most to them. With nearly 100 MLBA chapters around the world, employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and volunteering—and 100% of chapter contributions STAY with that chapter. Additionally, when local areas are hit hard by natural disasters or other crises, MLBA assists impacted employees, families and communities through our Disaster Relief Fund. Along with offering support and encouragement at every touchpoint of the organization, Alorica provides the administrative resources required to fuel this giving program as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative. Take a look at some of the ways MLBA is making a difference: Homelessness Prevention —MLBA has stepped in to prevent evictions Medical Assistance— MLBA provides assistance when medical bills become overwhelming Disaster Relief— Over $200,000 raised to date when natural disasters strike Funeral Expenses— We’ve been able to assist during the most trying times Download the MLBA overview to read about THE MLBA WAY and learn how the program works.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-do-analytics-factor-into-acquiring-retaining-customers","<h3><strong>The Importance of Acquisition and Retention</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s start with a couple facts. It’s been shown that: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>A 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%</li>
    <li>Brand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers, and 7x more than detractors</li>
    <li>Companies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value, and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passive</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p>The truth is, many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what’s the solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers, but maintaining the customer relationships
you already possess?</p>
<p>Simple. Analytics. </p>
<h3><strong>It’s Good to Get Analytical.</strong></h3>
<p>Analytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at
the right time, increase your propensity to connect, convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand. In addition, analytics let companies personalize the customer experience, reducing the need for mass sales pitches or
blanket selling. </p>
<p>Our extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day, lead demographics and scoring, bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And yet, analytics are practically
useless unless you can truly put them to work. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Actionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>The sad truth is that analytics are often only reported, and not analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities,
as potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics). &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists, predict propensity to connect and increase first-attempt
connects, all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>Access to analytics is important, but <em>analyzing</em> the analytics – putting the data to work for you – that’s where the difference is made. It’s all about predictive models that leverage
diverse sources of data such as text, survey responses, and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households, which, when coupled with Alorica’s 30 years of experience, allows us to fully
analyze and interpret information – and not just merely spit out numbers.</p>
<p>That’s how you gain customers. That’s how you <em>keep</em> customers. Simply put, that’s what grows your company. And growing your company is what

There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain this group–which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone–that one begins to wonder if they’re from another planet. While <a href=""/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">understanding and decoding this group</a> is paramount, there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them.<sup>1</sup> The most important weapon is your employer brand.<br></p><h3><strong>What is an employer brand…and why should you care?</strong></h3><p>As a textbook definition, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">your employer brand</a> is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about
    you. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes.<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup></sup>It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working environment and culture
    like? </p><p>The employer brand and <a href=""http://www.recruiting.com/blog/6-steps-building-employee-value-proposition"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">employee value proposition</a>&nbsp;have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more
    choices than ever before.<sup>3</sup> So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they’ve decided that they won’t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact, in one study, almost
    <a href=""http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/cc/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">70% of candidates</a>&nbsp;said they wouldn’t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p><p>So how do you create a great employer brand? &nbsp; </p><p>Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It’s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time. &nbsp;
</p><h3>Key component #1:&nbsp;<strong>Take time for self-reflection</strong></h3><p>Every company has an identity. &nbsp;It will typically include elements of your brand’s purpose, your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What’s

There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain this group–which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone–that one begins to wonder if they’re from another planet. While understanding and decoding this group is paramount, there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them. 1 The most important weapon is your employer brand. What is an employer brand…and why should you care? As a textbook definition, your employer brand is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about you. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes. 2 It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working environment and culture like? The employer brand and employee value proposition have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more choices than ever before. 3 So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they’ve decided that they won’t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact, in one study, almost 70% of candidates said they wouldn’t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed. 4 So how do you create a great employer brand? Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It’s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time. Key component #1: Take time for self-reflection Every company has an identity. It will typically include elements of your brand’s purpose, your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What’s important to your company, your CEO, your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to have)? Is yours a company where people actually want to work? Why or why not? This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core elements of your company, warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this. Key component #2: Authenticity above all else Candidates–particularly millennials–hate liars. Don’t try to be something you’re not. The whole point of this exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a quality match there. As you develop your employer brand, stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that. Key component #3: Develop a purpose-driven EVP Your Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers and their supervisors; engagement; authentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that? Key component #4: Become a great storyteller You have a great employer brand and compelling EVP, but don’t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong. In the real world, “if you build it” people will not come. You need to become a great storyteller to capture the attention of millennials and bring them to you. There’s a “secret sauce” for how do this , and of course, it helps if your employer brand’s voice and creative designs appeal to your target candidates. 5 But, make sure your designs reflect your company, too (see point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready, include them in all components of your talent acquisition strategies and engage millennials where they congregate (e.g., social media). As companies fish in the same millennial talent pool, it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer brand, you can do just that. SOURCES 1.

We are a company of people, a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility
    is to ensure that every Alorican is engaged, inspired and nurtured to succeed. &nbsp;
</p><p>As Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer, I don’t take this responsibility lightly. And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: <strong>Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless. Be True</strong>. With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work
    full-time from our homes, these values have taken on an even greater significance. They’ve kept us united even as we physically work apart, and we’ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many
    essential businesses—including contact tracing, food delivery and content moderation. &nbsp;
</p><p>As a minority-owned business, Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities. It’s why we stand up for those less fortunate, and it’s what led us to launch <strong>TIDE: Together for Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity</strong>.
 We’ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them. We’ve facilitated respectful, fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism, bias, sexual and gender
    identity, mental health and more. And through them all, we’ve learned about our people. We’ve listened to their stories. And we’ve grown—together. &nbsp;
</p><p>We take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit partner, <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA)</a>, has supported team members around the world in times
    of crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions, each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities—and to-date, we’ve given out almost <strong>$5M</strong> in grants
    in six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic, it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities—supporting causes and individuals in need. &nbsp;

We’re committed to Impact Sourcing—through which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities.
    Giving people the chance to earn a living, support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it’s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing—and so what’s good for the
    community is also good for the bottom line. &nbsp;
</p><p>And it’s not just our people that care about our efforts—our partners do too! Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR, and they want to team up with like-minded corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility

<p>It’s Women’s History Month y’all!</p>
<p>As a mother of six, wife of one and woman among millions, if I can give any advice to all the ladies out there, it is to lead by example. I’m so grateful to work at a company like Alorica where I’m personally encouraged to be bold, and my
teams run with it when I challenge them to do the same. Because after 30 years in the biz, I can say with certainty that YOU are your best advocate, and you have the power to make things happen for yourself.</p>
<p>When I first started out as a call center agent in my 20’s, I didn’t know it would take me to where I am today—the President of North America and Europe Operations for <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/"">one of the largest digital CX providers in the world</a>.
But I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new, kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example and lead in the same way. So, don’t
wait for someone to come tap you. Never say “no” to a chance to learn more skills. Make mistakes, learn from them, and move on. As I often say, “get over it.” You never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these
things. Most importantly, don’t follow a career path; build the one that’s meant for you.</p>
<p>This month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias—the theme celebrated around the world for International Women’s Day. Furthering <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion"">diversity and inclusion</a>&nbsp;is,
and should be, a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do, it enhances our business, company culture, and especially our people. At Alorica, we even have the numbers to prove it—our female population has grown since last
year with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that, but as the largest certified and award-winning minority-owned BPO, we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce to 71%. Why are these facts important?
Because strong representation of groups, such as women and minorities, matter to our employees, our clients and our customers—even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as a company, we are making progress.
There’s much work to be done, but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction.</p>
<p>As we continue Women’s History Month, I’d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion, sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change. These qualities, which have
sometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness, actually demonstrate our strength. We aren’t afraid to show these skills with conviction, strong execution and thoughtful leadership, and sometimes wearing bright-red heels. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE…watch

the site Agent of the Year award the following year! This was a huge milestone for my professional career, opening doors to Quality Assurance and Trainer roles. With support from my mentors, in 2018, I became the Onboarding Specialist for Panama,

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/outsourcing-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-company","<p>In 2015, <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/"">over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced</a><sup>1</sup>. It’s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources,
costs are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren’t generally available internally. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Top providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution? &nbsp; </p>
<p>Read on, dear friends. Read on. &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Six Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense</h3>
&nbsp;
<h4>1. You want to retain customers.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>Your current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain – and improve – an already exceptional level of service. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions – chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not
yet been considered). &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4>2. You want to acquire new customers.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>Bringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>While focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes – as it turns out, we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent
profile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind – companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see, on average, a <a href=""http://aberdeen.com/research/8675/ra-omni-channel-experience/content.aspx"">9.5% increase in annual revenue</a><sup>2</sup>.
&nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4>3. Specialized training requires detailed education.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>Certain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there’s just too much for one trainer to know – but additional coaching can’t be supported by
your in-house team. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>With a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4>4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>High-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don’t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>BPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar, work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions.
We excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you’re always staffed with the most qualified talent. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4>5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>As your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast – and thoughtful – solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses
the ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>A BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return
to focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4>You don’t have all the tech you need.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5>
<p>It’s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel, you’re missing out on opportunities
to enhance customer experience and loyalty. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
<p>BPOs have deep experience with analytics – going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels – voice, email,
chat, text, video and social media – customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>***</strong> <br>
Your company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values. Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless, blended partnership that benefits both sides. <br>

&nbsp;","In 2015, over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced 1 . It’s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources, costs are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren’t generally available internally. Top providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution? Read on, dear friends. Read on. Six Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense 1. You want to retain customers. THE SITUATION Your current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain – and improve – an already exceptional level of service. THE SOLUTION Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions – chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not yet been considered). 2. You want to acquire new customers. THE SITUATION Bringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line. THE SOLUTION While focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes – as it turns out, we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent profile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind – companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see, on average, a 9.5% increase in annual revenue 2 . 3. Specialized training requires detailed education. THE SITUATION Certain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there’s just too much for one trainer to know – but additional coaching can’t be supported by your in-house team. THE SOLUTION With a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met. 4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal. THE SITUATION High-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don’t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push. THE SOLUTION BPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar, work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions. We excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you’re always staffed with the most qualified talent. 5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls. THE SITUATION As your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast – and thoughtful – solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses the ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand. THE SOLUTION A BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return to focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures. You don’t have all the tech you need. THE SITUATION It’s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel, you’re missing out on opportunities to enhance customer experience and loyalty. THE SOLUTION BPOs have deep experience with analytics – going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels – voice, email, chat, text, video and social media – customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term. *** Your company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values. Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless, blended partnership that benefits both sides. Reach out to us any time, and let’s talk about how Alorica can make a win-win situation happen for you.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-microlearning-led-to-a-96-compliance-rating-for-a-major-retail-pharmacy-provider","<p>As a result of the average attention span being reduced to a mere eight seconds, people today are accustomed to finding an answer from a quick search. This is where microlearning comes in – it meets this expectation of consuming information, while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way of teaching and delivering content in small bursts, microlearning has been a key success factor for our agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, this pharmacy provider began to experience some challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant, ranging from financial loss to medication abuse, and in this highly-regulated industry, it was simply unacceptable. To fix the problem, Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved process compliance, but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it, microlearning.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Instead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation, we implemented microlearning — where we created a customized, brief, 10-minute video allowing agents to understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so, this helped close the culture gap to better align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program, we began collecting data on the effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves – the compliance rating improved to as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving — with an average of four training hours per full-time employee.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks to this new training method, the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information, while encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore, these microlearnings were cost-effective, resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral, salary for trainers, etc.).

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/the-key-to-compliance-a-microlearning-case-study","<p>While managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, a major retail pharmacy provider began to experience some slipping in prescription fulfillment compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The client came to us in search of an effective learning intervention, and we
presented them with the concept of microlearning. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>With a group that was skeptical of new approaches to training, you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. Challenge accepted. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduce ‘microlearning’ to revolutionize training protocols</li>
    <br>
    <li>Boost KPI scores</li>
    <br>
    <li>Win over a skeptical client</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Pilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by as much as 62%</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee</li>
    <br>
    <li>Microlearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Convince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day.</strong>
<br>
This one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site’s team was made up
of Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Furthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Challenge accepted. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Better Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores.</strong> <br>
Instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention <em>marathons</em>, we championed <strong>microlearning</strong>: a short, animated video that focused
on client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client
expectations. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Microlearning Makes Its Mark.</strong> <br>
Thanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s
digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions. Furthermore, microlearning is cost-effective, minimizing the need for traditional classroom training
and ultimately cutting development costs by 50%.</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;","While managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, a major retail pharmacy provider began to experience some slipping in prescription fulfillment compliance. The client came to us in search of an effective learning intervention, and we presented them with the concept of microlearning. With a group that was skeptical of new approaches to training, you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. Challenge accepted. THE CHALLENGE Introduce ‘microlearning’ to revolutionize training protocols Boost KPI scores Win over a skeptical client THE OUTCOME Pilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by as much as 62% Cost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee Microlearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program THE CHALLENGE Convince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day. This one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site’s team was made up of Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance. Furthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. Challenge accepted. THE SOLUTION Better Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores. Instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention marathons , we championed microlearning : a short, animated video that focused on client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client expectations. THE OUTCOME Microlearning Makes Its Mark. Thanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/3-principles-of-social-media-customer-service","<p>Multichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use, it's become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that <a title=""99 percent of brands surveyed"" href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">99 percent of brands surveyed</a><sup>1</sup> were on Twitter, while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account, Social Media Examiner said, citing Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are three principles to consider about social media customer service:
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. <strong>Different channel, same service:</strong> Just because there's a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted, the end goal is to directly address any question, comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue, a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However, if a customer makes a lighthearted comment, then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive
channel.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2. <strong>The quicker the response, the better:</strong> The average response time for respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours, with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day, a timely response is best practice when it comes to real­time communication. A Lithium Technologies study found that <a title=""53 percent of consumers"" href=""http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">53 percent of consumers</a><sup>2</sup> expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour, and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If brands neglect to respond, consumers take punishing actions. For example, 60 percent of respondents said they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. <strong>A social persona should be passive:</strong> When it comes to customer response, companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However, the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive, if anything. There are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores, but that doesn't give it a free pass to negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition.

If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it’s that businesses need to seriously assess their data

</p><p>Physical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company, particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers’ data is an essential component of providing top-notch

</p><h3><strong>Is your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant?</strong></h3><p>Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience), or you are <em>not</em> PCI compliant in-house, it’s critically important that
    your outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant. &nbsp;
</p><p>There are, however, varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification, but rather, tout “self-assessment”—which essentially means that they may not have
    been independently assessed, nor approved, by leading credit card providers. &nbsp;
</p><p>Be sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer:
</p><ul><li>Is the outsourcing partner PCI compliant?</li><br><li>If yes, has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), or are they self-assessed?</li><br><li>Is the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list?</li></ul><p>Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>PCI Security Standard’s website</strong></a><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and view their list of certified companies. &nbsp;
</p><h3><strong>Can your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data?</strong></h3><p>In 2013,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/frontline/2014/07/07/payment-card-data-isnt-the-only-lucrative-loot-in-a-data-breach/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>45 percent of data thefts</strong></a><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;involved non-payment card
    data. Protecting your customers’ payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers’ other personal data vulnerable. &nbsp;

</p><p>Remember—it’s not just payment data at risk, so it’s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry
    like utilities, customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account number, phone number, address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number. &nbsp;
</p><p>If non-payment data is breached, it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012, nearly 2 million customers of two&nbsp;<a href=""http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/1986D5ECA1917A8A8525798E005F81DD/$File/pr12007.pdf?OpenElement"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>New York-based utility companies</strong></a><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;had
 personal data such as their social security numbers, birthdates and other account information exposed. Since then, the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data—payment and non-payment—ask your outsourcing
    partner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected. &nbsp;
</p><h3><strong>Does your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout the customer journey?</strong></h3><p>You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures, but it’s also important to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. &nbsp; Consider questions
    like these:
</p><ul><li>Do your customers have the same experience with your payment processing partner as they do with your own representatives?</li><br><li>How much control do you have over these interactions?</li><br><li>Is your partner committed to providing an&nbsp;<strong><a href=""/outcomes/actionable-insights/alorica-analytics"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">exceptional customer experience</a></strong><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;every time?</li><br><li>Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS<sup style=""top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"">®</sup> and customer satisfaction outcomes?</li></ul><p>Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it’s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>Harvard Business Review</strong></a><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive
    experiences. You need to be certain you’re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions with your outsourcing partner! &nbsp;
</p><p>Selecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It’s about securing your customer’s data—all of it—and ensuring that every interaction with your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind
    when choosing your partner, you’ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that’s truly win-win.

If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it’s that businesses need to seriously assess their data security. Now more than ever, utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft, with hackers taking advantage of lax security standards. Physical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company, particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers’ data is an essential component of providing top-notch customer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security, it’s important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can be used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques. When selecting an outsourcing partner, here are three considerations your utility company should keep in mind: Is your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant? Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience), or you are not PCI compliant in-house, it’s critically important that your outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant.

Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the PCI Security Standard’s website 1 and view their list of certified companies. Can your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data? In 2013, 45 percent of data thefts 2 involved non-payment card data. Protecting your customers’ payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers’ other personal data vulnerable. Remember—it’s not just payment data at risk, so it’s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes.

Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS ® and customer satisfaction outcomes? Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it’s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the Harvard Business Review 5 last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive experiences.

</p><p>That’s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service.&nbsp; Remember, automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for building a strategic framework, you’ll be able to distinguish
    the simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework is as simple as two steps. &nbsp;
</p><br><h5><strong>Step 1: Dial in on Demographics</strong></h5><p>Consider the demographic of your caller—and your industry. A <strong>West Interactive Services CX Marks the Spot</strong> study found that customers’ likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service depends on the service provided.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;
</p><p>Take the Government Services/Healthcare sector, for example. While there is a larger appetite for interactive channels including online chat, self-help, etc., fewer customers are open to a mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast, in the Automotive
    sector, the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater, with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted channels. &nbsp;
</p><p>When it comes to age, non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a traditional service channel—phone, email, in-person, chat or self-help–whereas a Millennial is 5 to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media
    platform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for self-service automation. &nbsp;
</p><p>Launch your self-service engagement strategy early on, leveraging your customers’ profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how, when and where to market and engage customers on the available self-service channel options. After all, you
    want to bring the greatest value–targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer. &nbsp;
</p><br><h5><strong>Step 2: Revisit Customer Data</strong></h5><p>Take a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example – are they calling for password resets, package
    tracking, balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving, then it is more suitable for automation. &nbsp;
</p><p>Then, analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense
    of resolution? &nbsp;
</p><p>While originally designed for repeat contact reduction, the same steps work for all contacts. Identify contact reasons, develop solutions, check in to see that the plan is working and act to achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice
    to take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience. &nbsp;

<p>This client, a leading provider of Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services, sought to continue providing their customers with exceptional support during seasonal times of high customer enrollment. Alorica was called upon to create a flexible, burstable
staffing model to ensure that they were always meeting their customer’s needs, as well as providing information on new customer opportunities.</p>
<h4>THE PROGRAM</h4>
<p>The client was receiving a high amount of calls during their annual enrollment cycles. Unlike traditional mail services, the client’s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding high-end medications, while also providing those
customers new services for consideration. Consequently, the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales. &nbsp; </p>
<p>As they say in Gotham, when the Commissioner calls, you pick up. And we do. &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Alorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client’s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers. &nbsp; </p>
<p>That’s right. We doubled our workforce. That’s just the kind of thing we do for our clients. But we digress. &nbsp; </p>
<p>We deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensity-to-contact members, ultimately reducing the client’s overall cost per prescription. Furthermore, we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations,
and created welcome calls as part of a member’s engagement strategy. To do so, we analyzed landline leads, conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week
in which to contact them. Finally, we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative, low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case. &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>THE RESULTS</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Top performer for increasing prescription conversions, per contact, by 10-15%</li>
    <br>
    <li>Consistently a top performer among all of the client’s internal contact centers</li>

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/burnout-stinks-signs-and-solutions-to-prevent-call-center-burnout","<p>The burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found
    that employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty
    picture for the men and women in our organizations. It’s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it’s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017). &nbsp;
</p><p>Contact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer
    service representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than
    the national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014). &nbsp;
</p><h4><strong>What Exactly is Employee Burnout?</strong></h4><p>The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn’t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as
    “a syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do ‘people work’ of some kind” (Jackson, 1981). &nbsp;
</p><p>In the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister, 2016), agents <em>want</em> to deliver excellent
    service in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers.
    Agents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service. &nbsp;
</p><h4><strong>What Are Those Burnout Symptoms?</strong></h4><p>Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from their work. It’s an uphill
    battle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson, 1981):
    &nbsp;
</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Emotional Exhaustion:</strong> Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level.</li><li><strong>Cynicism Towards Customers:</strong> Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion.</li><li><strong>Professional Efficacy: </strong>“The tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one’s work with customers.” In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the consequences can
        be quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><strong>Solutions to Prevent Agent Burnout</strong></h4><p>In my experience, burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy.
    To prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must: &nbsp;
</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px""><strong>1. Avoid Favoritism</strong>: Treat people with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism.

        </p>","The burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found that employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty picture for the men and women in our organizations. It’s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it’s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017). Contact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer service representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than the national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014). What Exactly is Employee Burnout? The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn’t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as “a syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do ‘people work’ of some kind” (Jackson, 1981). In the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister, 2016), agents want to deliver excellent service in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers. Agents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service. What Are Those Burnout Symptoms? Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from their work. It’s an uphill battle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson, 1981): Increased Emotional Exhaustion: Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level. Cynicism Towards Customers: Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion. Professional Efficacy: “The tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one’s work with customers.” In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the consequences can be quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization. Solutions to Prevent Agent Burnout In my experience, burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy. To prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must: 1. Avoid Favoritism : Treat people with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one person or group against another, will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved. 2. Have Clear Values : Make sure that operational processes and the company’s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees perceive a value conflict on the job, their engagement with work tends to decrease. 3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: Establish continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact center environment. 4. Understand the Contact Center Environment: Training or seminars can enhance the employee’s capacity to cope with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead, the organization should start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself. Burnout is commonplace, and no one is immune to it. It’s important to structure your work environment so that every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed.

<p>Alorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck, and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model, this wasn’t our first WAH rodeo.
Far from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable, as we worked to migrate the
client’s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment—in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative—and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we’ll get to all that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>THE RESULTS</h5>
&nbsp;
<ul>
    <li>Attrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) agents in the same program</li>
    <li>Customers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&amp;M employees</li>
    <li>AHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&amp;M</li>
    <li>Contact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h5>THE CHALLENGE</h5>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Experience when it mattered most.</strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Prior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program—including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that
agents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding, training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing
model, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still, moving that many agents in
such a short timeframe—and against the backdrop of COVID-19—was no small order
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Best practices for a best-in-class result. </strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Time was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently. &nbsp;

Alorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck, and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model, this wasn’t our first WAH rodeo. Far from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable, as we worked to migrate the client’s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment—in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative—and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we’ll get to all that. THE RESULTS Attrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&M) agents in the same program Customers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&M employees AHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&M Contact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents THE CHALLENGE Experience when it mattered most. Prior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program—including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that agents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding, training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing model, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still, moving that many agents in such a short timeframe—and against the backdrop of COVID-19—was no small order THE SOLUTION Best practices for a best-in-class result. Time was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently. Existing best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents, and as they adjusted to their new at-home environment, we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both agents and leadership. These routines were grounded in a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards, two-way virtual agent communication, collaboration and top-notch leadership support—and were a vital component of previous and ongoing success.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/build-a-lean-mean-customer-knowledgebase-machine-for-effortless-self-service","<p>A streamlined troubleshooting guide can help effectively resolve a customer issue and improve the overall customer experience. Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service environment or through an interactive voice response system
(IVR). It’s a critical component of self-service, designed to empower the customer through the resolution process. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>In a time of information overload, it’s important to keep information accessible, current and accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to Salesforce, 75% of consumers say that say it is important
to be able to interact with a company on <em>their </em>personal schedule.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Follow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution and increases overall satisfaction. After all, the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making it easy for them to do business with you.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Identify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve</strong> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>As you build your customer knowledgebase, the first step is identifying possible scenarios or problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Some examples include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up an account</li>
    <br>
    <li>Resetting a password</li>
    <br>
    <li>Accessing an account</li>
    <br>
    <li>Reinstating service</li>
    <br>
    <li>Adding services to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs).&nbsp; HAPs help you to identify where the customer is when the need for help arises.&nbsp; Your strategy for how to design and deliver customer facing service content would be impacted
by the HAPs identified.&nbsp; A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>A recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are recommending that specific brand.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>As you think through potential reasons a customer would need support, keep in mind the customer lifecycle
of your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Create the Self-Service Content</strong> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now that you’ve compiled the list of potential customer issues, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential customer issues. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree and a process map.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on what occurs at each step.</li>
    <br>
    <li>A process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps, it’s important that you think about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For example, when you are guiding a customer through self-help,
it’s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the steps for resolution. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>It is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly.&nbsp; Resolving a customer’s issue through self-service doesn’t need to be complex.&nbsp; In a recent article, Gartner states that organizations often have
very complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and knowledge are key attributes of leading
enterprises.
<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Developing content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for both self-service and contact center support, the less content management you will need post-deployment. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Understand How Often Your Content is Being Used</strong> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>In any business, measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase.&nbsp; To measure the effectiveness of your content, you need to understand
how often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer’s issue.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>In a self-service environment, you can include a question—<em>Did this information resolve your issue?</em> —after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In a contact center environment, the agent can ask the question, or you can collect the data through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer’s issue, it’s also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for searches. This insight will help you optimize
your search functionality and your content management strategy. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Maintain Your Self-Service Content</strong> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>A knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately, it increases the effort required by your customers as they search through large quantities
of content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt an unnecessary increase in call volumes. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Even further, too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand.&nbsp; Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand
because of the ability to easily find the information or help they need.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>You must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center, but content management will ultimately drive your success. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>To be successful at content management, define a process to update your knowledgebase.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Establish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Maintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Update the key search words based on current content available.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Remove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites replace the original articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their own issues in a way that’s fast and easy. A study
by Ganter predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever needing to interact with another person.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>In this DIY era, offering self-service is a necessity. It shows you are listening and understand the way your customers want to be served. Meanwhile, it deflects unnecessary call volumes thereby reducing your overall cost per transaction. Using an effective
knowledgebase content plan to deliver an effortless self-service experience compliments customer support and provides the customer multiple ways to resolve their issue. When done effectively, this drives improvement in the overall customer experience
and improves how customers feel about your brand. &nbsp;

</p><p><strong>We will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing.</strong> Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint &nbsp;
</p><p>“Standard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches
    to handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in
    that funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.”

</p><p><strong>We will see a stark divide in an organization’s marketing budget spend, followed by consequential impact.</strong> Jim Kruger, Chief Marketing Officer, Veeam &nbsp;
</p><p>“With the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year, there will be a resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end, companies will look to cut back on marketing budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be
    managed up or down fairly easily. On the other end, companies will increase investment in marketing because they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead, those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will
    ultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on, and by toggling budgets up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue
    to invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Verifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. </strong>Dan Lowden, Chief Marketing Officer, White Ops
    <br>“In 2021, marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing spend. Marketers will partner with specialists
    that can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans – resulting in better customer experience, ensuring higher engagement, bringing visibility to cleaner data, improving the company's compliance position and driving
    stronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is effectively spent.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Recent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise their walls even higher.</strong>Abhay Singhal, CEO, InMobi Marketing Cloud &nbsp;
</p><p>“This is an extremely uncertain period of time, and CMOs shouldn’t have one roadmap – they should have multiple. For starters, marketing teams will need to be prepared to make the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing
    within the app. On the flip side, marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as possible. Without this, advertisers are
    at risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over, which compromises brand image and user experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical, and marketers need to start setting expectations and redefining metrics
    as soon as possible.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Company culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing talent.</strong> Amanda Bohne, Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta &nbsp;
</p><p>“Now that so many companies have proven that, for many, remote work can be as effective as in-office work, it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will
    now be sought after by companies located across the country, enabling them to potentially live somewhere different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company where in-office work is mandated will
    start to meaningfully impact your candidate pool, and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>No matter what product you sell, what you need to market is trust. </strong>Dale Renner CEO, Co-Founder, RedPoint Global &nbsp;

</p><p>“Consumers want trust in the product quality, trust in the organization handling your data, trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs, trust that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately
    driven through a series of interactions – those brands that are responsible with a consumer’s data and use it to create value for the consumer, those that provide consistent experiences, those that operate at the consumer’s cadence
    will build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy, will experience a dramatic decline in customer loyalty and brand value. ” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>B2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with existing customers.</strong> Elena Filimonova, SVP, Marketing CGS &nbsp;

</p><p>“Marketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits of their service, while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers,
    Marketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the current environment.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Google and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and data privacy.</strong> Susan Lee, Chief Product Officer, Valassis &nbsp;
</p><p>“In the new year, it’s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on
    a one-to-one or known basis. Instead, marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base, maximizing scale.” &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Omnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty.</strong> Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer, <a href=""https://alorica.com/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a> &nbsp;

</p><p>“In today’s 'continuously-connected' way of life, it’s not enough that brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX—being able to alternate quickly from different platforms, but for these channels to also be personalized, persistent and effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021, you’ll
    see more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers’ wants through advanced analytics and embedded intelligence, which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that allow brands to market, sell and serve
    their customers better and faster. When brands proactively ‘push’ tailored experiences rather than rely on customers to ‘pull’ from services after they’ve had a problem, that changes the nature of the relationship, offering
    insights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of always-connected consumers, new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights, context and channels that ultimately redefine
    brand loyalty.” &nbsp;

To find out, I sought insight from the following nine tech executives . We will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing. Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint “Standard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches to handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in that funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.” In terms of digital fluency, marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we’d be going into 2021.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/designing-a-survey-strategy-6-tips-for-success","<p>A common topic of conversation in the customer experience world is the ideal customer satisfaction survey. How many questions should it include? What are the right channels? How do you increase survey return rates? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>While these questions make sense, are they the right questions to ask? Rather than trying to find the perfect survey (minimal questions with insightful answers, and a high rate of return), companies should consider asking a different question—is
the current method for delivering surveys generating the data needed to improve the business, as well as the overall customer experience? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>A better use of time and resources is to reevaluate the strategy used to gather sentiment. Use these 6 tips as a starting point to help ensure that you continually receive useful data from the consumers that best represent your customer base.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>1. Ask the right people.</strong></h5>
<p>The people answering your surveys are likely not the best representatives of your customer base. According to Gartner, the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and very upset. This creates a data set that
omits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the majority of the company’s customers.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>To gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses
crave, it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate, which leads to our next point. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>2. Keep customers from saying, ‘No way, survey!’</strong></h5>
<p>Surveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your user quitting the survey part way through, and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Businesses who are focusing on
how to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to communicate, and tailor the channels utilized accordingly. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>3. Ask the right questions.</strong></h5>
<p>Several companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction questions. These general questions don’t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to improve a business. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Survey Monkey suggests that
companies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization—and making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights—is what will help you reach your goals.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Think
about what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent performance, customer loyalty to your brand, or both? Answer these questions, and you will know the questions to ask. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>4. Keep the survey relevant.</strong></h5>
<p>Gainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how the request arrives. <sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl,<a href=""https://www.shopify.com/retail/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-beacon-technology-for-retail-stores"">*</a>&nbsp;over 70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a purchase during a store visit.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to be bold when considering options!
&nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>5. Show the value.</strong></h5>
<p>Customers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback on a product or experience. Don’t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole. Show customers a direct correlation
between feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by trumpeting improvements made to products/services
based on direct customer feedback. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>6. Use the data available to you.</strong></h5>
<p>Most businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and voice analytics solutions can be used to
analyze interaction transcripts, providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view several different aspects of their business—products, support service options and agent interactions to name a few. &nbsp; </p>

cover everything to consider for your customer feedback gathering strategy, but it is a starting point. What other items would you consider?&nbsp;For help getting started, or for a more in-depth review of customer experience best practices, contact

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/finding-ohmni-channel-nirvana-3-ways-to-get-there","<p>Customers making contact expect a company to wrap together all forms of communication from traditional to social. In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether they’re shopping online
from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;By the time
they connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise, they wouldn’t
be calling to begin with. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Consider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be
recognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn’t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It’s
crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn’t add significant length to the interaction. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Many companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes, integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn’t allow for the continuous experience
of true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration, what’s left is a solution that causes more harm than good, leaving the burden on the contact center
agent to resolve a complicated case. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>As you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you’re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>1. System consolidation:&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<p>How many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history? &nbsp; </p>
<p>If the answer is more than one, it’s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember, the more history the front
line is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>2. Multichannel platform integration:</strong></h5>
<p>Does your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage? &nbsp; </p>
<p>If the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social media, and AI, the details of these touches must
push to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience. &nbsp;
</p>
<h5><strong>3. Employee experience considerations:</strong></h5>
<p>Now that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents?
</p>

</ol>","Customers making contact expect a company to wrap together all forms of communication from traditional to social. In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether they’re shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store. 1 In the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store. 2 By the time they connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise, they wouldn’t be calling to begin with. Consider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be recognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn’t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It’s crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn’t add significant length to the interaction. Many companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes, integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn’t allow for the continuous experience of true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration, what’s left is a solution that causes more harm than good, leaving the burden on the contact center agent to resolve a complicated case. As you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you’re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success. 1. System consolidation: How many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history? If the answer is more than one, it’s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember, the more history the front line is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience. 2. Multichannel platform integration: Does your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage? If the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social media, and AI, the details of these touches must push to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience. 3. Employee experience considerations: Now that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents? As employee expectations become more complex, training investments will be critical to ongoing success. Consider what concepts, such as routine system changes, can be easily adopted through online content delivery. While even the best Learning Management System will not replace the need for facilitator-led content, moving simple content to employee self-service can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and procedural changes to be delivered live in a classroom environment. As you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities, make sure your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will require additional expertise and research time, especially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity, you will invest in agents’ knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened expectations and to prevent employee pool burnout.

</p><h4 style=""text-align: center""></h4><p style=""text-align: left"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left"">Here at Alorica—a global Customer Experience (CX) provider—I lead the efforts in engaging some of the most reputable financial institutions in the world to offer our customer support services as an extension of their business. One great question
    I get asked often from financial services executives is—<i>how should they integrate ‘digital’ in a meaningful way to earn customers’ satisfaction, trust and long-term business?</i> The reality is consumers expect personalized
    service from the companies they do business with. And while for some industries, like retail, that’s innately part of every brand’s identity; for others, like the banking, financial services, and insurance sector (BFSI), giving customers
    the digital experiences they want isn’t so simple. Here are some of BFSI’s challenges and the best ways to solve for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left""><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h5><b>Make It Personal&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</h5><p>Consumers, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels, elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial
    institutions know them—especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information. For many large institutions, the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause additional frustration. As a personal
    example, when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card, the customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not integrated. This made me feel undervalued
    as their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX solutions, built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML, along with system integration, can help create tailored product recommendations,
    savings plans, and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. <a href=""https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/what-does-personalization-banking-really-mean"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">As Boston Consulting Group shared</a>:
 “Ultimately, if done well, personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking, it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for banks.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><b>Give Them Options</b>&nbsp;</h5><p><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-banking-study-reveals-growth-benefits-of-personalization-innovation-and-trust-in-customer-experience-301674711.html"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude</a>,
 financial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver more rapid responses, the need
    to keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use multiple channels to complete transactions,
    it can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging situation. The customer will want
    to be heard, discuss their options, and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank employee will guide them through the process. That’s why balance and optionality are key.&nbsp;</p><p>Self-service options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel solutions, enhanced self-service options, improved functionality across digital channels, and 24/7 live support can help reduce the friction,

International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (<a href=""https://www.iaop.org/"">IAOP</a>) recently launched its long-awaited Social Responsibility in Outsourcing (SRO) Chapter with its inaugural webinar, “The Evolution of Socially Responsible Outsourcing: Relevant Now More Than Ever.” Participating in the webinar, included Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee, along with representatives from other leading organizations including Facebook, Microsoft, Sprint and BSR.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For the webinar, Alorica represented service providers in the BPO industry, offering our take on the benefit and impact of a CSR program. Besides the obvious reasons that it’s the right thing to do and our clients care about it, Alorica believes being socially responsible is “<strong>just good business</strong>.” Being in the people-to-people business, our employees are truly our greatest assets, thus we pay attention to what attracts them, motivates them and keeps them. The result? We’ve created a culture of giving back, connection and empowerment through our CSR programs.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So how do we do that? One way is through our partnership with <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a> (MLBA), a global non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of people in need around the world. Alorica employees lead the nearly 100 chapters worldwide, where they are empowered to support individuals, local organizations and communities that matter most to them. In less than four years, MLBA chapters have raised and distributed millions of dollars in grants and disaster relief, and our clients are noticing these efforts! One example is through our partnership with Intuit where we were selected to help with their latest impact sourcing project, establishing a <a href=""https://www.bdtonline.com/news/things-are-falling-into-place-intuit-hiring-going-strong-at/article_0412c28e-c6d7-11e9-b829-b7a2a793f6a2.html"">Prosperity Hub</a> in Bluefield, W.

This initiative will bring hundreds of jobs, providing locals with career opportunities and support through MLBA, with the end goal of helping the people there to help themselves and their own community.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a client was looking to drive more members to its loyalty program, they turned to a group that could transform information into insights—and win back their valued customers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Increase adoption of their loyalty program</li>
    <li>Improve the win-back of members who hadn’t used</li>
    <li>the loyalty program for more than six months</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>THE OUTCOME</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%</li>
    <li>The program generated a profit of $10 million—130% of the client’s goal</li>
    <li>The full solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group, and 19% over the client’s internal sales team</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>THE CLIENT</h4>
<p>So here’s what happened. A major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for Small/Medium Business (SMB) accounts. The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program, and to improve the win-back of members
who hadn’t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>THE PROGRAM</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1</strong> of the solution involved utilizing Alorica’s data scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring
    Model), comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling, was thusly launched.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2</strong> implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 3</strong> saw Alorica providing full account management of the client’s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client’s profitability. Meanwhile, a sales CRM system and digital sales strategy
    intelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics. And our CAE came through in the clutch, delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer, resulting in an optimal contact strategy, increased
    positive customer experiences and higher revenues.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>THE RESULTS</h4>
<p>The revised Welcome Program increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%. Meanwhile, the win-back program increased usage by 37%, generating a profit of $10 million – 130% of the client’s goal. And to top it off, the full account management and analytical solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group, and 19% over the client’s internal inside sales team.</p>
<p>Turns out, when you don’t do everything by the numbers,
you end up with some pretty good numbers.</p>

Read her full Q&amp;A below.
</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">How did you reach your career goal of becoming a director?</font> <br>After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital
part of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn’t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I’d be a great fit. My “stick-to-it-ness”
paid off!
</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What do you find most rewarding in your role?</font> <br>Seeing my team’s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we’re always working with several different people. Being in this
central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation.</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way?</font> <br>I would definitely say (now Alorica’s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly Hanak-Weaver, who I reported to as a proposal
manager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team, while empowering them, too. I try to copy off her great leadership style—we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be.
</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What’s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path?</font> <br>At any job, it’s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your
career changes, you’ll find that by maintaining a professional network, you’ll always have connections available for referrals, advice and encouragement.
<br><font color=""#98521c""><br>Any additional advice for work life?</font> <br>Don’t be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change. And roll with challenging
situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long run.</p>","With an appreciation for the creativity of writing, advertising and graphic design, Tonya Goforth pursued a degree in Business Management with an emphasis in Marketing.

Now, as Alorica’s Director of Sales Enablement, she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&A below. How did you reach your career goal of becoming a director? After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital part of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn’t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I’d be a great fit. My “stick-to-it-ness” paid off! What do you find most rewarding in your role? Seeing my team’s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we’re always working with several different people. Being in this central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation. Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way? I would definitely say (now Alorica’s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly Hanak-Weaver, who I reported to as a proposal manager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team, while empowering them, too. I try to copy off her great leadership style—we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be. What’s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path? At any job, it’s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your career changes, you’ll find that by maintaining a professional network, you’ll always have connections available for referrals, advice and encouragement. Any additional advice for work life? Don’t be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change. And roll with challenging situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long run."

mentors said, if you fail, just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your comfort zone. So, I started out with a small account, and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it—the exposure with the client, getting
into calls with client solutions, making decisions about what is good for the business, and getting to know the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big, new site in Jamaica, I knew I could do it even though it would be new for
me. &nbsp;
</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: What motivates you every day?</b><b><br>A:</b> I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the better you can overcome
the roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes, whether good or bad. The fourth one is to
get to know your people—not only at the professional level, but at the personal level. Talking to people builds loyalty, and that’s how you get people to not work for you, but to work with you. &nbsp;
</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: If you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now, what would it be and why?</b><b><br>A:</b> Sometimes I think, what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every
decision I’ve made, good or not so good, they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with everything I have accomplished. I wouldn’t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to training, I didn’t want to leave, but
it was a good decision. From there, I got to try new things. There’s so many branches in this business. You’d be surprised about what you might succeed in.
</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female?</b><b><br>A:</b> I have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I’ve seen many women
in this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in a man’s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama, and I was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers. I
was able to stand up and lead that task. &nbsp;

of this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet, despite these efforts, not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and prioritized. &nbsp; </p>
<p>In this blog, I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline ‘the discovery stage’ and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>From manual to automated discovery&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Alorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage, calling it ‘One-Click Automation’. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents’ desktop utilization on a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors
the users’ screen toggle, clicks, data entries and entry type, and tracks time per system and per screen, the time duration for performing each step, and the number of used fields. It counts errors, frequency, variance in the time and data entry
quality, the end-to-end handling time, the complexity, and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the underlying communication between systems and exchanged information. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The bot does not capture personal data or other input information, remaining non-invasive to the systems. It also does not intervene with the users’ actions. Once the bot collects enough information (~100k data points per LOB, typically in two weeks),
it creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens, the start and end points, the navigation between them, and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product portfolios with multiple support processes
(for example, in technical support), Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru, launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results, estimate savings opportunities, and recommend and prioritize bot implementations
with workflow business process, exceptions adjudicator, and look-up. Because the collected information shows the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data, the created automation workflows make the bot training quicker and
more precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Implementations for a healthcare client</strong></h4>
<p>For a U.S. healthcare payer client, Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant number of agent desktops for three days, identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with tasks such as secondary claims research, multifactor
case, clinical guidelines, and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of agents who performed the particular process, its recurrence, and time taken. The team compared the results to the agent training guidelines, then
Alorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Alorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client’s voice and non-voice work. For example, in the client’s back-office, the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax.
Using third-party RPA &amp; AI partner tools, Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or compliance requirements such as HIPAA.
It also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount who translated the data from the
claims to the systems. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a ‘digital workbench’ for back-office processes, leading with automation. For automation opportunities in voice processes, Alorica is working
with several travel, retail, BFSI, media and telecom brands. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Automation in the process trenches</strong></h4>
<p>The fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume, time-consuming processes, sizable FTE involvement, high error rate, or simply, risk aversion by internal IT teams. To address the latter issue, Alorica automation
deployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising, changing or modifying core client systems. The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion with the client’s process owners
on the possible cost-benefit and ROI. &nbsp; </p>
<p>A less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with dynamic changes of internal rules, product/services, and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will be quite short and its ROI smaller without human
supervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the challenge of identifying process impact. To
mitigate automation program redesigns, Alorica’s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure with a steady release roadmap. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Another challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost optimization and improved performance, Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet, looking to take over higher value processes, and switching to performance-based
pricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client, Alorica structured the pricing by processed claim, decreasing the overall cost by ~50%. &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>The value of partnering for automation</strong></h4>
<p>While broad statements for full automation attract media attention, the reality for most companies is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider
can deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario, where the vendor has the process and domain expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and supplier network centers to maximize
the benefits.</p>","One of the first stumbling blocks of business process transformation is identifying meaningful automation opportunities.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/aloricans-are-straight-up-awesome-and-we-re-gonna-show-you-why","<p>For the past three years, during the season of love and in partnership with non-profit <a href=""http://www.livesbetter.org"">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a>, the nearly 100 Alorica employee-led Chapters around the world participated
in the “Share the ♥” contest. Chapters were tasked to demonstrate and post on Facebook how they shared the love in their community. To make the contest a little more interesting and in celebration of Alorica’s 20<sup>th</sup>anniversary,
Chapters were also encouraged to incorporate this milestone into the photos they shared. &nbsp; </p>
<p>And the winner is… <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Making-Lives-Better-with-Alorica-Panama-617201538682716/"">Panama West</a></strong>!
<br>
The Panama West Chapter partnered with <a href=""http://www.fundacreoenti.com/"">Fundación Creo en Ti</a> (I Believe in You), an organization that fosters 65 young boys during the school year. And it just so happens
that the non-profit is also celebrating its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. School supplies and personal items were donated during the visit.</p>

<br>
<strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Alorica.TucsonWestAZ/"">Tucson West, Ariz.</a></strong> <br>
Taking second place in the contest, the employees of Tucson West shared the ♥ twice in their community. First,
they collected socks and a variety of hygiene products, distributing them to the homeless. They also donated clothes, bedding, feminine goods and Valentine cards to the Wayward Winds shelter for women and children in need.</p>

Chapters were tasked to demonstrate and post on Facebook how they shared the love in their community. To make the contest a little more interesting and in celebration of Alorica’s 20 th anniversary, Chapters were also encouraged to incorporate this milestone into the photos they shared. And the winner is… Panama West ! The Panama West Chapter partnered with Fundación Creo en Ti (I Believe in You), an organization that fosters 65 young boys during the school year. And it just so happens that the non-profit is also celebrating its 20 th anniversary this year. School supplies and personal items were donated during the visit. But let’s face it, we’re all winners here. Here is a recap of how a few of our other Chapters shared the ♥: Tucson West, Ariz. Taking second place in the contest, the employees of Tucson West shared the ♥ twice in their community. First, they collected socks and a variety of hygiene products, distributing them to the homeless. They also donated clothes, bedding, feminine goods and Valentine cards to the Wayward Winds shelter for women and children in need. Cybergate Third place went to the MLBA Cybergate Chapter, who continued its partnership with My Dream in a Shoebox, an initiative to empower underprivileged children to fight poverty through education.

assume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: “listen to understand.” We sit and we listen, but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and
be successful. &nbsp;

position, and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the site director position, I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks. I went through agent training,
I took calls, I sat with the QA team, I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be set up for success, to have credibility, and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can’t be afraid to ask, and asking isn’t
a weakness. &nbsp;

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-ways-to-turn-your-customers-experience-into-continuous-improvement","<p>The moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or service, is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer
    support call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>1. Know Your Customer</strong> &nbsp;
</p><p>Segmentation is powerful.&nbsp; When your customers ask for assistance, it’s important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment. Demographic information goes without saying, but focus should also be
    given to the&nbsp;<em>type</em>&nbsp;of customer a person is.
</p><ul><li>How long have they been a customer?</li><br><li>How many of your products do they own?</li><br><li>How often are they reaching out for support?</li><br><li>What past issues have they needed assistance with?</li></ul><p>Having this insight helps in the way you communicate with the customer later, while also helping you understand how to position self-service and working to find the right solution. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>2. Identify the Problem</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>It may seem simple, but often, companies are not collecting information around&nbsp;<em>why</em> the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue&nbsp;<em>type</em>&nbsp;is critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better
    self-service content, while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus on driving improvements. In the Forrester article, “<em>Insights-Driven Business Set the Pace for Global Growth”, </em>Forrester
 references that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with close-looped learning processes.”<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p><p>In an era where information changes so rapidly, the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better for the customer, the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level. &nbsp;
</p><p><strong>3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their support experience. However, it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to resolve the issue. The more effort required, the more the experience
    deteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook<em>,&nbsp;<a href=""/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Deflecting Call Volume</a>;&nbsp;</em>resolution is identified as the largest
    influencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only detrimental to experience scores, but also, they are expensive to support. Therefore, understanding what drives and prevents resolution is a critical
    component of your contact reduction strategy.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; </p><p>When we think of resolution, we think of it two ways.
</p><ul><li><strong>First Contact Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;It’s crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or
        knowledgebase articles are solving your customer’s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content, potentially reducing support calls and driving improvement in customer support.</li><br><li><strong>Issue Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Issue resolution is a measurement of whether the customer’s issue was resolved. It’s important to understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where
        you typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred, escalation to a higher level of support, etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved, you will likely see an impact to their overall experience
        given the delay in resolution. Remember, resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain customer loyalty.</li></ul>&nbsp;

<p><strong>4. Build Brand Loyalty</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>One of the best indicators of a customer’s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem will allow you to better
    understand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. &nbsp;</p><p>Information is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn will set you apart from others in your industry.&nbsp; In a recent blog by COPC, “The Value of Listening: How feedback can be an
    opportunity to bring brand image to life,” the author mentions that customers are paying more attention to how a brand responds than ever before.<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>As you better understand your customer segment, how often they call,
    the types of issues that occur for them, what upsets them and the speed with which&nbsp;you can help them, you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar customers. When you listen to your customers
    and begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner, you reduce the frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your customers. &nbsp; </p><p>Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a support model that simplifies the path to your customers’ resolution is important. As you leverage learnings from your customers’ experiences and incorporate those into your
    ever-changing support model, you begin to reduce the number of support calls required, the length of the call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of your support model will go down and you
    will gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their problems. Customers know issues will arise, but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what will set you apart from your competition.

In recent history Generation X was known as a group of “Slackers.” Before Gen X, the original “ME” generation was the “Hippies”, the Baby Boomers who are now so worried
about these “lazy, entitled, narcissistic” Millennials. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>You can’t understand anyone accurately when you’re judging them… and that’s exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO,&nbsp;<a href=""http://achievemulti.wpengine.com/mi/files/2015/08/MIR_KeyTakeaways-2.pdf"">Damar Services</a>&nbsp;said, “I find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have
encountered many who are thoughtful, resourceful, open-minded and even visionary community stewards … Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.”<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And for
contact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce, Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor market—with 56 million now working.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Rather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly, get to know them as individuals. You’ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground! &nbsp;
</p>
<p>You would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly, we haven’t. This is one “way that it’s always been done” that it’s time to let go of, and here are 6 great reasons why. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>#1. Data doesn’t tell the whole story</strong></h5>
<p>Millennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic, feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind, the reality is that they are not that different from the generations that came
before them.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;While the data we read may be statistically accurate, much of it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science—like the reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup
Organization—while accurate, doesn’t tell the context of the Millennial experience. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Why? Because these surveys don’t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new life stage called “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"">emerging adulthood</a>”. According to Haydn
Shaw, generational and cultural differences expert, recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28 is important because, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"">if it’s the Millennials</a>,
then it’s a problem that needs to be fixed…if it’s a life stage, it’s a change that we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>#2. Millennials work to live, not live to work</strong></h5>
<p>Millennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives—even above their careers.&nbsp;According to Darlene Corbett, a therapist and success coach, “like many generations before Millennials, marriage and family are part of
the big picture for the Millennial population.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>But there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families&nbsp;<strong><em>and</em></strong>&nbsp;fulfill career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for leadership development,
they should create a work environment that respects personal values, especially related to family. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Find ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to build a great career without damaging their personal relationships. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>#3. Millennials desire personal growth</strong></h5>
<p>Work-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the things that matter most to them—such as health, family and leisure time.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Millennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous feedback and coaching and that’s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore, capitalize on the opportunity to mentor them. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Gen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY, the purpose behind how work gets done every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them, encourage them, inspire and motivate them, and challenge them to greatness. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Companies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise invest in those who need and desperately want to
grow? Sounds like a win-win. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>#4.&nbsp;Millennials live their ideals</strong></h5>
<p>According to Jean Case, Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation, Millennials invest in the things they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy than in previous years, and put an emphasis on
CSR in the workplace.<sup>6</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>A common adage in leadership is to “walk the talk”. Well, Millennials are doing just that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on, or better yet, follow suit. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Recognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in organizations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>#5. Millennials number 73 million&nbsp;</strong></h5>
&nbsp;
<p>Millennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America’s largest generation in 2019, with 73 million individuals. In fact, as of 2017, Millennials were already the largest population in the workforce—with 56 million working or looking for
work.
<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<h5><strong>#6.&nbsp;Millennials are the future (like it or not)</strong></h5>
<p>As Padraig Cotter points out “Millennials are redesigning the future of work. They’re digital natives and it’s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it’s about&nbsp; the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking
are crucial, and Millennials can provide this.”<sup>8</sup> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Oftentimes, fear holds us back – fear of the unknown, fear of change or just blind fear. But there’s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make their mark on the world. Let’s not succumb
to fear and judgment just because we don’t know or understand them. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Millennials and contact centers are a perfect match. Get behind Millennials, invest in them, and support them as they take you to places you’ve never gone before! Read the proven ways to recruit and retain this valuable and qualified workforce in&nbsp;

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/utility-industry-looks-to-omnichannel-support","It all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review. Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada, representing more than&nbsp;<a href=""http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/""><strong>39 million residential accounts</strong></a><sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;Of those,&nbsp;<a href=""http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/""><strong>44 percent receive services</strong></a><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;from a retail energy provider (REP), as of year-end 2014.
&nbsp;
Although the legislative environment is still very much in flux, utility companies increasingly recognize the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product or service, new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the consumer relationship.
&nbsp;
In this highly controlled industry, demand from utility providers, REPs and consumers to provide more immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction with consumers. Currently, Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to communication—specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues related to service and payments can be conducted.­­ As a result, many companies have moved to un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified operation for three key reasons: <strong>Consistency, Focus on Customer Experience, and Improved Revenue Recovery</strong>.
&nbsp;
Alorica, a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector, has introduced Financial Care (through its subsidiary, EGS Financial Care, Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the industry that focuses on Care, First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation, who prefer Web-based self-service options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid energy).
&nbsp;
As they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels, utility regulators and electricity providers should consider the following market trends:
&nbsp;
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consumers are increasingly mobile.</strong>Smartphone technology and cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere, anytime – everything from turning devices on and off, to re-programming their thermostat settings, to making a payment. And as technology continues to advance, consumers will look for further innovation from utility providers related to mobile platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumers want more control over costs.</strong>The idea of prepaid electric service – based on previous consumption rates – has already gained traction with consumers who are now seeing <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/""><strong>energy savings between 5.5 and 14 percent</strong></a><sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;However, this model brings with it new challenges; specifically, protecting customers who may underestimate their usage, particularly because&nbsp;<a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/""><strong>utility companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service</strong></a><sup>4</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart meters mean more programs.&nbsp;</strong>Smart meters, which measure energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes, have opened up opportunities for time-based rate programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates,&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.smartgrid.gov/recovery_act/time_based_rate_programs.html"">consumers can benefit</a><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</strong>from the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates.&nbsp;Energy companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings.</li>
    &nbsp;
</ul>
New developments in technology, combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices, means that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences, or be left behind with antiquated systems and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly tools, electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further positive change for the industry as a whole.
&nbsp;
When you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change, many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience, resources and PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions—eliminating significant capital expense, time delay and HR challenges.
&nbsp;
Through outsourcing, Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience and satisfaction ratings. Talk about a brighter outlook for everyone.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/level-up-gamer-loyalty-in-digital-first-experience-economy","<p>There are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts &amp; online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers, and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns
that entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building—and brand loyalty—is customer support, which has taken
on greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">current gaming boom</a> is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive
growth in the past, with <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/the-8-generations-of-video-game-consoles/zvcjkty"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">eight generations of consoles</a> recruiting a whole new crop
of hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery
ordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a result, a comprehensive player support
strategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation. &nbsp;
</p>
<h4><strong>All-Inclusive Player Support</strong></h4>
<p>The gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that
took shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service, as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew

</p>","There are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts & online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers, and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns that entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building—and brand loyalty—is customer support, which has taken on greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers. The current gaming boom is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive growth in the past, with eight generations of consoles recruiting a whole new crop of hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery ordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a result, a comprehensive player support strategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation. All-Inclusive Player Support The gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that took shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service, as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew by the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics, such as account management & payment processing, plus community moderation, knowledge management expansion, live events support, and protecting gamers against fraud. Then there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe, so video game companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every time zone. Even better, support agents should have the regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down, gaming companies need to adopt robust CX services now or risk losing players to the companies that do.
