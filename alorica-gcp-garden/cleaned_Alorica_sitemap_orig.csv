        ","<h4>The Company’s TIDE Initiative Provides a Forum for Alorica’s 100,000 Employees to Embrace Diversity and Inclusion</h4><p><strong>IRVINE, Calif – Oct. 25, 2021</strong>—<a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a>, a <a href=""/awards-recognition/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">global leader in digital customer experience (CX) solutions</a>, earned first place in <em>PR Daily’s</em> 2021 Nonprofit Communications Awards, recognized for “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Communications.” Alorica was awarded for its Together for Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity (TIDE) initiative, a cornerstone of the employee experience and blueprint for conversations on social issues that matter to the company’s global workforce. </p><p>“Alorica set itself apart from an outstanding field of entrants in PR Daily’s Nonprofit Communications Awards,” said Brendan Gannon, Marketing Manager for awards programs at Ragan Communications and PR Daily. “The company’s work was exceptional and displayed their innovation strategies for achieving success.” </p><p>As the world’s largest minority-owned business process outsourcing (BPO) company, Alorica has always prioritized diversity and inclusion in its hiring and development practices. In 2020, Alorica launched TIDE to continue to encourage inclusivity, celebrate diversity and achieve equity for its 100,000 employees. Alorica identified a group of diverse and experienced leaders throughout the organization to collaborate on program development, while also collecting feedback from employees to learn about the issues most important to them. These TIDE teams helped organize and lead a steady cadence of <em>“Real Talk”</em> sessions – virtual discussions where employees can openly and safely talk about DEI topics. In the first year, Alorica employees participated in more than 50 <em>Real Talk</em> sessions around the globe including special fireside chats on key topics, such as Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQIA+ community. During these sessions, employees have the chance to listen, share personal experiences, ask questions, uplift one another and discuss ideas on how to make lives and communities better. Additionally, Alorica issues a quarterly TIDE newsletter to share insights and inspirational stories emanating from these group conversations. &nbsp; </p><p>“It’s been an incredible experience learning, growing and sharing as a community and family throughout the process of developing our TIDE program and the <em>Real Talk sessions</em>,” said Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee. “DEI is engrained in our culture and part of who we are. So, we are proud to be recognized for our grassroots initiatives, but the work is far from done and we’re just getting started.” &nbsp; </p><p>PR Daily’s 2021 Nonprofit Communications Awards recognize the engaging and powerful communications efforts from the past year. Program winners represent the people, teams and organizations whose powerful storytelling and campaigns, partnerships and projects helped build awareness of, or raise funds for important causes, initiatives, organizations and programs. &nbsp; </p><p>Through its <a href=""/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">corporate social responsibility</a> program, Alorica remains focused on initiatives supporting philanthropy, people and the planet.

The digital CX provider is also a certified and award-winning Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), employing 100,000+ people around the world—60% of which are women and 70% in the U.S. representing minorities.<br></p><p><i>“Alorica is founded on the principle of diversity, and we are proud of our programs to elevate inclusivity, creating opportunities to embrace equity across our teams,”</i> <b>said&nbsp;G</b><b>reg Haller, Chief Executive Officer at Alorica.</b>&nbsp;<i>“Our commitment is to foster a culture where all our employees feel empowered to own their career journeys at Alorica. Being an employer of choice means we see, hear and act on what our people need. In return, our employees do the same for our customers by delivering exceptional service. As our business grows, we continue to invest in leadership development initiatives rooted in DEI principles to strengthen our bench, while making a difference in the communities we operate.”</i></p><p>One of the ways Alorica supports its employees’ learning and development is through its Women’s Initiative.

        ","<h4>Spearheaded by CCO Joyce Lee, Making Lives Better with Alorica Distinguished for Grant Funding, Charity Collaboration and Resource Coordination</h4><p><b>IRVINE, Calif – Oct. 7, 2021</b>—<a href=""https://www.alorica.com/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a>, a <a href=""/awards-recognition"">global leader in digital customer experience (CX) solutions</a>, announced today that its Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee and non-profit partner <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a>(MLBA), have been named a Silver winner in the 18th annual Stevie® Awards for Women in Business, recognized for “Most Valuable Non-Profit Response”. Lee was honored for leading MLBA’s efforts to provide pandemic relief through a culture of connection and empowerment, spanning grant donations, charity support and resource assistance. &nbsp; </p><p>“Alorica’s program was a standout among this year’s entries, demonstrating tremendous work and support for those impacted by the pandemic,” said Maggie Gallagher Miller, President of the Stevie® Awards. “This campaign not only reached a large number of people, but empowered Alorica’s staff to make a true difference in their communities. Making Lives Better with Alorica is a remarkable endeavor to be encouraged.” &nbsp; </p><p>As the Founder and President of MLBA—a nonprofit led by Alorica employees—Lee initiated COVID-19 relief efforts to help recipients with essential needs, such as rent, water and utilities to prevent homelessness as well as to cover costs for medical care, groceries, sanitary supplies and funeral expenses for those who tragically lost loved ones. In 2020, the nonprofit raised nearly $867,000 in monetary donations, awarded 924 grants totaling $527,000, assisted 400+ families through crisis relief efforts, and supported 68 charities globally. &nbsp; </p><p>MLBA was also recognized for directly supporting a number of charities and organizations in the fight against COVID-19. This includes WeNeedMasks.org to combat supply shortages of PPE; Catchafire, where Aloricans could virtually volunteer with other nonprofits; the Red Cross to attract volunteers to donate blood; and Second Harvest Food Bank to host food distributions, <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/charities-and-organizations-helping-to-fight-covid-19/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">among other organizations</a>. Additionally, Lee led the charge in organizing an online information center for resources to help those in need take care of themselves, their families and their communities. This portal included federal, state, local and Alorica corporate assistance for necessities like food, utilities, unemployment benefits and healthcare. &nbsp; </p><p>“People turn to MLBA when they have nowhere else to go for help and unfortunately the pandemic became one of those situations for many people around the world,” shared Lee. “I’m grateful that Alorica and MLBA were able to play a role in providing essential funds, critical resources and hope during these times. I’m constantly inspired and in awe of people’s generosity, kindness, creativity and humanity especially when it matters most. This award is a recognition to all the #MLBAHeroes who contributed to make a difference.” &nbsp; </p><p>The Stevie® Awards for Women in Business honor women executives, entrepreneurs, employees, and the companies they run—worldwide. More than 1,500 entries were submitted this year and judged by a panel of 160 business professionals from around the world. &nbsp; </p><p>Through its <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">corporate social responsibility</a> program, Alorica remains focused on initiatives supporting philanthropy, people and the planet.

        ","<p><strong>IRVINE, Calif., May 19, 2021</strong>—<a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc</a>., a global leader in customer experience solutions, has been named a Silver winner in the 2021 Stevie® Awards for Minority-Owned Business of the Year. As the largest minority-owned business process outsourcing (BPO) provider in the world, Alorica is certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by both the National Minority Supplier Development Council and Southern California Minority Supplier Development Council. Recognition by the Stevies affirms Alorica’s alignment with clients’ goals to hire and source from diverse and minority-owned companies. &nbsp; </p><p>“This commendation by the Stevies highlights important company milestones as we continue to develop a diverse, inclusive and equitable workforce. I’m proud to share that more than 60% of our employees is made up of women and nearly 70% of our US workforce is comprised of minorities,” said Andy Lee, Chairman and CEO of Alorica. “Our people are everything, and we believe there is unity in diversity. As part of our company culture, we embrace inclusivity and camaraderie and will continue to empower and learn from our employees to make lasting change in the world.” &nbsp; </p><p>The 2021 program marks Alorica’s third Stevie Awards win in this category. This year’s recognition honors Alorica’s outstanding achievements as a minority-owned business, including the establishment of <a href=""/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">TIDE</a>, a grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) program that is now an integral part of the company’s global employee experience. Through TIDE’s ongoing Real Talk series, employees at all levels have an interactive forum to increase awareness, share experiences and develop creative solutions to social issues in our communities. TIDE was introduced in 2020 under Alorica’s global <a href=""/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Corporate Social Responsibility</a> program, which is anchored in Philanthropy, People and Planet. </p><p>The 2021 Stevie Award is among several accolades Alorica has received since last year. The company was distinguished as an <a href=""/news/detail/alorica-named-an-impact-sourcing-champion-on-iaops-first-ever-distinguished-list/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Impact Sourcing Champion</a> by IAOP in July 2020 for strategically hiring thousands of employees around the world from underserved communities.

Clifton assumes responsibility for the company’s global information technology (IT) organization and initiatives, overseeing the design and delivery of digital technologies and strategies for Alorica’s continued success. &nbsp; </p><p>“Mike is a proven leader in digitization with a passion for innovation and creating solutions that drive results for clients,” said Andy Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Alorica. “With a breadth of experience across IT, operations and sales, he will play a key role in advancing Alorica’s mission to transform the next generation of omnichannel customer experiences.” &nbsp; </p><p>Clifton has over 30 years of experience in software, technology, operations and sales, having held CIO and CISO titles at numerous companies. He joins Alorica from Cognizant, one of the world’s leading professional services companies, where he served as both CIO and Chief Innovation Technology Officer. In these roles, Clifton led global IT, operations and data, in which he oversaw the design and implementation of digitization strategies, IT organizational models, new market growth, and service-level management. Prior to Cognizant, Clifton held C-level positions at Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Hanover Insurance Group, Nobilis Software and others. &nbsp; </p><p>“If customer loyalty reflects a brand’s health, then CX management is the lifeblood of every corporate enterprise,” commented Clifton. “Alorica is known for innovating digital-first CX strategies and modernizing the customer journey across industries. As the company continues to expand, I could not be more thrilled to join the team.” &nbsp; </p><p>Clifton succeeds outgoing Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer Steve Phillips, who joined Alorica in 2018. Phillips brought a combination of strategic technology leadership and operational discipline during his time with the company and led the transformation of Alorica’s IT organization into a strategic asset for both the company and its clients. &nbsp; </p><p>“Under Steve’s leadership, Alorica made significant progress enhancing our security posture, aligning our business and clients’ interests, and bringing forward new technology solutions that matter to our clients,” added Lee. “We are grateful for his many contributions and wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.” &nbsp; </p><p>“It has been an honor to lead Alorica’s IT organization for the last three years,” said Phillips. “Alorica is dedicated to delivering world-class CX solutions and it’s been inspiring to see the progress made by the Alorica team over the last few years to advance our IT platforms to deliver against that mission.

Alorica’s <a href=""/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">work-at-home solution</a> integrates its data-protected, omni-channel technology with its award-winning employee experience programs to power its globally distributed workforce. The Alorica Anywhere platform empowers agents with gamified digital tools &amp; resources to build skills, performance and culture in a distributed workforce model. Agents give regular input on their confidence and satisfaction which fuels Alorica’s big data system to collect real time feedback on performance at every stage of the employee lifecycle and ensures continuous optimization of delivery. Dashboards provide the transparency clients expect and the tools necessary to deploy best practices, focus on critical opportunities and scale the WAH operating model globally. &nbsp; </p><p>“An insanely great customer experience is a direct result of an insanely great employee experience,” said Chief Marketing Officer Colson Hillier. “And what worked in a brick-and-mortar environment doesn’t necessarily translate in this new virtual world. So, we took our proven service blueprint process for improving CX and applied it to our own operations to create this new WAH delivery model. It’s an entirely new system derived from our big data learnings, unique culture and 17 years of WAH experience, and it’s been critical to transitioning nearly 70% of our global workforce to a distributed model while maintaining performance for clients.” &nbsp; </p><p>The <a href=""/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""> Alorica Anywhere platform</a> has been an important driver in the company’s WAH success, having re-engineered Alorica’s system to adapt to the ‘new norm’. This includes offering 100% virtual hiring, instructional design customized for WAH training, new agent-assist tools and real time performance dashboards. As a result of its launch, our WAH delivery yielded a 7% increase in eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score), leading to improved attrition and fill rates, 6% better overall performance and 100% continuity of services for hundreds of clients across all industries. &nbsp; </p><p>“We’re optimizing both the employee and customer experience through our digital platforms, data intelligence and ability to make calculated changes at every level throughout the organization. Our philosophy is to act on the feedback from agents who are closest to the customer and leverage technology to capture, interpret and use data from a broad range of “listening posts” including speech analytics, anomaly detection, eNPS and performance reports. We aggregate these signals and quickly troubleshoot issues through our AI-enabled platform to ensure confident employees are delivering exceptional performance while maintaining a positive culture in a digital environment,” explained Hillier. &nbsp; </p><p>One of the most well-protected digital platforms for highly complex and confidential customer data, Alorica Anywhere touts world-class security that meets various industry standards and includes features like data masking, identity management, access-control desktops, secure payment transactions and more.

        ","&nbsp; <h4>New Hybrid Contact Center and Work-at-Home Model Supports Local Economy While Addressing Increasing Demand for Talent Expansion and Business Continuity</h4><p>IRVINE, California (March 25, 2021)—<a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc</a>., a global leader in customer experience solutions, today announced its continued growth in <a href=""/insights/resource/alorica-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-fact-sheet/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Latin America </a>(LATAM) by establishing a new contact center in Cali, Colombia. As Alorica scales and diversifies its world-class talent, Cali serves as the latest investment to provide clients across a variety of industries with next-generation solutions to exceed their CX needs. In the second quarter, Alorica plans to hire locals for both onsite and work-at-home positions. <br>“As we continue extending our global footprint, our growth in the LATAM market has never looked stronger,” said Brian Delaney, President of LATAM &amp; Caribbean Operations at Alorica. “Expanding our presence to Colombia enables us to offer more premier CX services in both English and Spanish. Laying roots in the vibrant city of Cali bolsters our talent pool, allows more optionality to our clients, and enhances the impactful customer interactions we’ve been known to deliver for over 20 years.” &nbsp; </p><p>Alorica has more than 17 years of experience in LATAM and the Caribbean, already operating in seven countries including the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama and Uruguay. As an ideal growth engine, the region delivers bilingual talent, with physical proximity and cultural similarity to the U.S. and continues to attract clients focused on business continuity and resiliency, while remaining cost-efficient. The new presence in Colombia will expand Alorica’s in-demand nearshore operations and further its reputation as one of the largest customer service providers in the world.<br>As a recognized <a href=""/culture/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">customer service BPO leader</a>, Alorica demonstrates its commitment to investing in its people by focusing on employee engagement and performance. Through constant evaluation of the employee Net Promotor Score (eNPS), coupled with <a href=""/awards-recognition/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">award-winning training programs</a> and culture initiatives, Alorica strives to remain the “best place to work”. The results are increased employee satisfaction, lower attrition rates and leaders being promoted from within the company year over year. Leveraging its <a href=""/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">work-at-home solution—Alorica Anywhere</a>—not only allows the company to provide further flexibility to clients, but also to employees. Through a versatile operating model, Alorica offers gamified digital tools including a mobile app to help agents hone their skills, improve KPIs and build confidence, while sharing real-time feedback at every stage of the employee lifecycle to ensure high-quality service delivery. &nbsp; </p><p>“As a family-founded and led, minority-owned business, our people are everything,” added Delaney. “Our dynamic company culture is made possible because we hire and develop talented Aloricans from diverse backgrounds and geographies. And as part of our <a href=""/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">corporate social responsibility</a>, impact sourcing remains among our highest priorities so we may also benefit the communities where our employees live and work. We’re looking forward to creating many jobs in Colombia.” <br>Alorica’s new call center is strategically located in the Palmetto Plaza Shopping Mall alongside the top universities in Cali.

On average, ENERGY STAR-certified buildings and plants use 35 percent less energy, cause 35 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions and are less expensive to operate than their peers—all without sacrificing performance or comfort. Over the next year, Alorica plans to certify additional sites and will perform energy audits at several of their buildings to ensure ongoing compliance and achievement of targets.</p><p>Alorica’s building in St. Joseph received an ENERGY STAR score of 83, making it the most efficient Alorica building in North America. In April 2022, St. Joseph completed its light emitting diode (LED) retrofit project, resulting in annual electrical savings of $50,000 and energy reduction of 515,000 kWh, an equivalent to CO2 emissions from 41,068 gallons of gas consumed. Alorica’s Corpus Christi site received an ENERGY STAR score of 80, thanks to its installation of LED lighting and energy-efficient HVAC units.</p><p><i>“I’m extremely proud of this recognition as we expand our presence in North America,”</i> said <b>Jay King, President of Alorica’s North America Operations.</b> <i>“It represents our company-wide commitment to sustainability as part of our ESG initiatives.

The Planet pillar focuses on sustainability and reducing carbon footprint and waste. Alorica prohibits practices that harm ecosystems and is always looking for ways to minimize the use of natural resources, while maintaining recycling programs around the world. Since 2019, the company experienced a total reduction of over 30 million kWh throughout the region due to a decrease in heating, cooling and electricity consumption. Additionally, it expanded its robust Work-at-Home program,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/continuity/alorica-anywhere"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Anywhere</a>, to further minimize impact on the environment by significantly reducing work commutes and the usage of office supplies globally.

The company’s experienced team offers CX design, deployment and operations in over 30 languages, to leading companies across a range of in-demand industries.</p><p>Matt Sims, President of EMEA Operations at Alorica, emphasized the benefits that the new office brings to businesses seeking global expansion. ""Our scalable and flexible solutions enable companies to globalize their business, especially with our strong and expansive language support. We provide customized delivery capabilities based on longstanding operational expertise and global best practices,"" he said.</p><p>With the launch of its new site, Alorica plans to hire hundreds of locals in the area for both onsite and remote careers. Spanning over 4,700 square meters across two floors, the new office—which is strategically located in the REACT building near Galeria Lodzk—boosts capacity to accommodate 650 employees to start and offers attractive amenities, accessible transportation and surrounding retail stores to help promote economic development and promising career prospects for the local workforce. </p><p>Leading the operations at our new Łódź location is Poland’s Site Director Kamila Wozniakowska, a Łódź native with an impressive 14-year tenure in the BPO industry. ""Kamila's journey began in operations as an agent, and her extensive industry knowledge is complemented by her expertise in operations and project management. Throughout her career, she has spearheaded business improvement projects in high-velocity settings and has adeptly managed digital transformation operations and relationships with key clients. Her local roots and industry acumen make her an invaluable asset to both Alorica and the Łódź community,” said Sims.</p><p>The centralized new location is efficiently equipped to accommodate both on-site and work-at-home options, catering to a multicultural and multilingual team. This investment underscores Alorica's commitment to contributing to the region's progress in becoming a world-class business hub. Alorica Poland has already begun forging strategic partnerships locally to bolster talent acquisition in the country through collaborations with industry associations and leading educational institutions. These partnerships enable the company to recruit top-tier professionals, contribute to enriching the local economy and fostering community development. Last year alone, Alorica promoted over 5,000 team members in which more than half were women, which led to the company earning an award for Achievement in Developing &amp; Promoting Women. </p><p>""Alorica is a well-recognized global CX provider that I’m excited to help lead here in my country as the company continues to grow across EMEA,” said Kamila Wozniakowska, Alorica Poland’s Site Director. “Not only does Alorica stand out for its industry-leading solutions, but also for its award-winning culture.

        ","<h5>Leading CX Provider Delivers Historic Volumes in Social CX Services During the Pandemic</h5><p><strong>IRVINE, California (August 31, 2020)</strong> –<a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a>, a leading global customer experience solutions provider, has announced the expansion of its digital support offerings to meet surging client demand. As the world adjusts to evolving COVID-19 guidelines—closures, stay-at-home orders and social distancing—Alorica’s suite of services is tailored to <a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">digital CX</a> including social media customer care, content moderation, online reputation management and online fraud protection. To manage the influx of these programs along with the company’s overall growth this year, Alorica is making significant investments totaling approximately $50 million, which includes <a href=""/news/detail/alorica-rapidly-expands-with-global-hiring-effort-to-fill-more-than-33-000-positions"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">the hiring of 33,000 employees</a> to keep consumers and brands connected in this digital economy. &nbsp; </p><p>Through its pandemic-proof platform, Alorica helps clients promote and protect their brands’ digital presence by managing and moderating their social media engagement, online communities and forums, business listings and customer reviews, advertisements, search engine rankings and more. Currently supporting over 30 countries in more than 15 languages, Alorica handles nearly a billion social CX transactions per year. This work is done on behalf of the largest companies in the world across key industries, such as digital entertainment and social media networks, ecommerce and online marketplaces, software and consumer electronics, online banking and on-demand delivery apps. Additionally, thousands of Alorica’s problem-solving global team members handle content moderation to safeguard brands and online communities from abusive content. &nbsp; </p><p>“In a feedback economy where brand reputation is defined by public opinion, Alorica helps companies engage, be discovered and recommended online,” said Chris Crowley, Alorica’s Chief Commercial Officer. “We help increase impressions, engagement and ultimately spend on behalf of our clients. For social media customer care alone, we manage more than 54 million interactions annually.” &nbsp; </p><p>During COVID-19 where online activities like shopping, live streaming and social networking have become more prevalent, associated risks have also increased with alarming speed. According to Sift’s Q2 2020 Digital Trust &amp; Safety Index, in the first half of 2020, online marketplaces were hit with a 109% increase in attempted identity theft with nearly half of it being financially motivated scams. Utilizing leading fraud prevention systems for the past 10 years, Alorica delivers solutions for identity &amp; credit monitoring as well as detection of account takeovers, fraud and data breaches—resolving over 2 million fraud cases annually for online customers. &nbsp; </p><p>“Our job is not only to protect our clients’ brand equity and their customers’ trust, but also to keep the internet safe. As digital interactions continue to grow at a tremendous rate, this responsibility becomes even more important, explained Crowley. “Based on our ability to deliver on the overwhelming need so far this year, we have experienced 128% growth in managing these social CX programs, and we’re looking forward to seven-fold growth in this space by 2022.” <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>About Alorica</strong> </p><p>Alorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

        ","<h4>Doing Good Around the World by Hiring People in Disadvantaged Circumstances</h4><p><a href=""http://www.alorica.com/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a>, a&nbsp;global&nbsp;leader in customer experience solutions, today&nbsp;announced it has been selected&nbsp;to be included in IAOP’s Impact Sourcing Champions Index in partnership with the Global Mentorship Initiative (GMI). The Index is IAOP’s inaugural list of companies that have distinguished themselves as trailblazers in Impact Sourcing. &nbsp; </p><p>Companies implementing Impact Sourcing prioritize providing career development opportunities to people who otherwise have limited prospects. According to IAOP, it has been shown to provide many business benefits, including access to new sources of talent, higher levels of employee engagement, and lower attrition rates, while offering employees their first step onto a career ladder that leads to economic self-sufficiency. As Alorica continues to grow and hire thousands of locals in the countries it operates around the world, the company remains committed to creating career paths for those most in need. &nbsp; </p><p>Debi Hamill, IAOP’s CEO, explained, “Doing well by doing good is now more important than ever. Ensuring that disadvantaged populations have access to formal employment and decent work, allowing them to improve their conditions, acquire a career, and thus lift themselves, their families, and their communities out of poverty is one of the most suitable means to economic growth. I am proud of the work these organizations are doing.” &nbsp; </p><p>“We are honored to be a part of IAOP’s Impact Sourcing Champions Index,” said Joyce Lee, Chief Culture Officer at Alorica. Our vision of making lives better one interaction at a time doesn’t just apply to the customers we serve, but also to our Aloricans around the world, especially those who just need a little hand up to better support themselves, their families and their communities. As a large employer in many of the countries we operate, we will keep doing what we can to create a positive impact wherever we can through impact sourcing, which has never been more important. It’s the right thing to do and we look forward to continue partnering with organizations like IAOP to be a part of the solution.” </p><p>Joyce Lee also serves as a Co-Chair of IAOP’s SRO Chapter. The Social Responsibility in Outsourcing Chapter (SRO) is chartered with promoting awareness for how the BPO industry can embrace social responsibility in their business strategy.&nbsp;The Chapter was created to encourage companies to share their success and learnings from implementing various socially responsible models including; impact sourcing, establishing a social mission and tactics, ethical labor practices, sustainability, and industry collaboration.&nbsp;To find out more about Alorica’s Corporate Social Responsibility, go to: <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">https://www.alorica.com/corporate-social-responsibility/</a><strong></strong></p><h5><strong><br>About Alorica</strong></h5>Alorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

        ","<em>The resulting 1.2 billion-dollar Alorica is now one of the industry's largest brands, offering expanded capabilities, service offerings and delivery options</em><strong><br>Irvine, Calif (January 9, 2015)</strong>&nbsp;<br><a title=""Alorica"" href=""http://alorica.com/"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica</a>, a worldwide leading provider of customer management outsourcing solutions, today announced it has signed an agreement to acquire several of West Corporation’s (NASDAQ: WSTC) agent services businesses for a consideration of $275 million. In 2014, these businesses represented approximately $580 million in revenue. The acquisition broadens Alorica’s product offerings and market reach, enhances the company’s delivery capabilities and allows Alorica to continue its sustained, aggressive growth on a global scale. Now one of the largest US based Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) providers, the new, integrated Alorica projects $1.2 billion in revenue in 2015. <br>“West, is one of the pioneers and most successful players in the BPO industry,” said Andy Lee, CEO, Alorica. “Today’s acquisition strengthens Alorica’s market position, allows us to scale faster and expands our reach into new vertical markets. By combining the strengths of both companies, we will be able to deliver immediate value to our customers.” West’s agent services businesses provide large-scale customer contact solutions to a wide range of vertical markets. The strategic acquisition strengthens Alorica’s market position in three key areas: <ul><li><strong>Global footprint:</strong> Increases company’s geographical presence in the US, Latin America and the Philippines, while adding a market-leading work-at-home capability</li><li><strong>Markets: </strong>Enters Alorica into new markets, including healthcare, utilities and government, while strengthening Alorica’s position in communications, retail, travel, financial services and consumer products</li><li><strong>Services: </strong>Expands current services offerings in customer care, technical support and sales, and adds receivables management and direct response capabilities</li></ul>The integration of West’s agent services businesses’ workforce will add an additional 1,500 nearshore employees (Jamaica and Mexico), 5,400 offshore employees (Philippines) and 18,400 domestic employees, bringing Alorica’s employee headcount to 48,000 employees. Over 5,000 of the 18,400 domestic employees work as part of the award-winning West at Home service. As a developer of one of the first work-at-home solutions, West utilizes state-of-the-art technology and a proprietary work force management system, Spectrum™, which will become a core component of Alorica’s work-at-home service offering. <br>“Alorica and West share a passion and track record for excellent performance and possess unparalleled industry knowledge,” continued Lee. “This acquisition is the next step in our strategic vision to grow Alorica to become the number one BPO provider in our addressable markets.” <br>“Alorica is committed to supporting West agent services customers and employees going forward,” said Tom Barker, chairman and CEO, West Corporation. “Our company cultures and technologies are complementary, and we will work closely together to ensure a smooth transition.” <br>Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of the West provided committed financing to complete the transaction. Wells Fargo Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to Alorica. McGuire Woods LLP acted as legal counsel to Alorica.

        ","<h4>Leading Global CX Provider Helps MLB Kick Off New Season with Two Bronze Awards for Contact Center of the Year and Customer Service Training Team of the Year</h4><p>IRVINE, California (April 5, 2021)—<a href=""/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a>, a global leader in customer experience solutions, announced today that it helped its client Major League Baseball (MLB) take home two Bronze Stevie® Awards in the 15th annual Stevie Awards for Sales &amp; Customer Service. MLB was recognized in key categories—Contact Center of the Year and Customer Service Training Team of the Year—with operational areas supported by its contact center provider Alorica and customer experience management tool partner Zacoustic. &nbsp; </p><p>“We operate a vast number of properties in order to give our fans the best experience possible, which requires a partner with expertise, scale and flexibility to create and maintain meaningful customer experiences and satisfaction across all brand platforms and touchpoints,” said Raymond Maccio, Senior Vice President of E-commerce &amp; Customer Service for MLB. “During a tumultuous time, sports have continued to serve as a welcome reprieve from the stresses associated with the pandemic. We couldn’t do what we do so successfully without the remarkable work of partners like Alorica that share our commitment to providing the best customer experience for our patrons. We’re excited for this new season.” &nbsp; </p><p>Despite the disruption of COVID-19 on the baseball season last year, Alorica seamlessly supported MLB’s consumer-centric culture and provided incredible experiences for MLB viewers. In the peak of Spring Training 2020, Alorica deployed hundreds of agents across several contact centers but quickly adapted when the season became delayed. As the season resumed, Alorica once again had hundreds of agents ready to handle Opening Day customer contact volumes. As a result, Alorica helped MLB achieve all-time record customer support levels on Opening Day last season—improving average handle time by 50% compared to past years, and empowering employees to become a voice for the MLB customer through strategic coaching and training opportunities. &nbsp; </p><p>Per <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/pe/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/Boosting%20contact%20center%20performance%20through%20employee%20engagement/Boosting-contact-center-performance-through-employee-engagement.ashx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, customer service agents who are highly engaged and highly satisfied are three times more likely to feel extremely empowered to resolve customer issues.

For example, Alorica receives customer satisfaction data for 100% of interactions through Zacoustic’s calibration system.

The success of our shared efforts demonstrates Alorica’s commitment to bring together the right combination of technology and data to drive performance analytics, leading to award-winning results in a rapidly changing environment.” &nbsp; </p><p>Founded in 2002, The Stevie Awards organize eight of the world’s leading business awards programs.

Faster and better—it’s not an easy code to crack! But then again, they don’t call us for the easy ones. </p> <p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong> <br> A New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing ‘confidently-held misinformation’ by using an industry-leading learning analytics technology platform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period, confidently-held misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn, this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention, and thus the ability to better navigate customer billing queries. </p> <p>In short, we were able to identify a problem the client didn’t even know they had—and then offer a solution that would totally change the game.</p> <p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong> <br> We’re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful, the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business. Furthermore, we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents, who appreciated a novel, innovative and interesting approach to their training. </p> <p>Overall, the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency, observed a decrease in risk and loss, and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction—all of which led to happier agents, happier customers and a happier client.</p> &nbsp;",pa worldwide telecom provider was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speedtoproficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business we implemented an innovative learning analytics solution designed to root out agent training problems at the source nbsp p pafter running a pilot program the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative download our cracking the code a learning analytics case study to learn more p h4strongdata science to the rescuestrongh4 pspeedtoproficiency—the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully serve their customers—is a driving key performance indicator kpi for companies looking to streamline operations one such company—a worldwide telecom provider—was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speedtoproficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business p pstrongthe challengestrongp ul lito implement an innovative learning analytics solution—designed to root out agent training problems at the sourceli br lirun a pilot program the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformativeli ul pstrongthe outcome strongp ul lieradication of agent struggles—impacting newhire trainee proficiencyli br li5 reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 daysli br li6day reduction of newhire training timeli br li80 knowledge retention after 1 yearli ul pstrongthe challengestrong br an empowered agent starts with better training traditionally the client’s agent training program was lengthy and costly—not to mention that agents weren’t consistently retaining all of the needed information to resolve customer billing inquiries enter alorica our training and quality teams took a look at the situation and asked—how can we shorten the training process while still helping agents retain knowledge faster and better—it’s not an easy code to crack but then again they don’t call us for the easy ones p pstrongthe solutionstrong br a new platform for challenging the status quo our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing ‘confidentlyheld misinformation’ by using an industryleading learning analytics technology platform the platform revealed that through a multiweek training and nesting period confidentlyheld misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules in turn this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention and thus the ability to better navigate customer billing queries p pin short we were able to identify a problem the client didn’t even know they had—and then offer a solution that would totally change the gamep pstrongthe outcomestrong br we’re just getting started our pilot program was so successful the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business furthermore we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents who appreciated a novel innovative and interesting approach to their training p poverall the client achieved faster speedtoproficiency observed a decrease in risk and loss and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction—all of which led to happier agents happier customers and a happier clientp nbsp

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/dont-diss-disruptive-tech,"<p>Don't diss disruptive tech - because it's here to stay, and it's awesome! &nbsp; </p><p>Download our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better…one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica, we’re all about using disruptive using technologies in our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we’re using to change the game—and the results we’ve seen so far. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MICROLEARNING </strong> </p><p>80% of our new hires are millennials—and given their average 90-second attention span, we’ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging. We call this new approach microlearning—short, interactive, 2-10 minute videos that deliver information “just in time”—right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional “just in case” classroom learning, Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and help reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>In action:</strong> Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)—leading to significant cost savings for the client. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>GAMIFICATION </strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Turning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning— that’s gamification. Through it, employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance, see how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards. &nbsp; </p><p>We customize our systems to each client’s individual objective, and drive agent effort from “acceptable” to “optimal” performanc with game played and reward earned. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>In action:</strong> Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance, attrition, absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It’s simple—engaged employees, who receive a boost in recognition and incentives, perform better. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>ROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Movies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity, but they’re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster, reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant. &nbsp; There are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view, allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA is all about workflow computerization, and these robots identify manual, repetitive and rules-based processes—tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent, and with complete accuracy. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>In action:</strong> For a major energy company, robotic automation reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10%, and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major telecommunications firm, robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing hundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks &nbsp;</p><p><strong>DON’T DISS DISRUPTIVE TECH BECAUSE IT’S HERE TO STAY —AND IT’S AWESOME!</strong><strong>CHATBOTS</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Job-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels, and we’re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to their automated nature, chatbots can handle simultaneous candidate inquiries, provide real-time responses and conduct initial applicant screenings. And because they operate 24/7, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and ultimately hire.</p><p><strong>In-action:</strong> In three months’ time, we were able to interview approximately 3,000 candidates, compared to 966 during the same time-frame without chatbots—saving over 1,200 recruiting man-hours and reducing the cost-per-hire by 84%.</p><p><strong>SPEECH ANALYTICS</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This new tool is leading to all kinds of ‘a-ha!’ moments. Through Speech Analytics, we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information. Are customers calling about billing? Technology? Something else? How did the call go? Was it a good customer experience? What could we be doing better? &nbsp; </p><p><strong>In-action:</strong> Speech Analytics radically enhances our Quality Assurance model through technology. It allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better capabilities, identify call trends and themes, and help us create even more insanely great customer experiences.</p>&nbsp;",pdont diss disruptive tech because its here to stay and its awesome nbsp ppdownload our overview to learn more about how were finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better…one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies at alorica we’re all about using disruptive using technologies in our daytoday operations read on to learn more about some but not all of the tools we’re using to change the game—and the results we’ve seen so far nbspppstrongmicrolearning strong pp80 of our new hires are millennials—and given their average 90second attention span we’ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging we call this new approach microlearning—short interactive 210 minute videos that deliver information “just in time”—right before the lessons are applied typically more effective than traditional “just in case” classroom learning microlearning videos are quick tothepoint and help reduce the need for agents to sit in long 8hour powerpoint classroom training sessions nbsp ppstrongin actionstrong microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80 for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider and retained up to 20 more information than traditional comparative training classes—leading to significant cost savings for the client nbsp ppstronggamification strong nbsp ppturning nongame experiences like providing customer care into fun competitive events that motivate encourage and reinforce learning— that’s gamification through it employees can interact with a gamelike platform to evaluate their performance see how they stack up against other agents and earn points that are redeemable for rewards nbsp ppwe customize our systems to each client’s individual objective and drive agent effort from “acceptable” to “optimal” performanc with game played and reward earned nbsp ppstrongin actionstrong businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance attrition absenteeism and overall satisfaction it’s simple—engaged employees who receive a boost in recognition and incentives perform better nbsp ppstrongrobotic desktop automation rda robotic process automation rpastrong nbsp ppmovies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity but they’re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant nbsp there are two types of robotic automation rda consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime rpa is all about workflow computerization and these robots identify manual repetitive and rulesbased processes—tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent and with complete accuracy nbsp ppstrongin actionstrong for a major energy company robotic automation reduced average handle time aht by 10 and error rates improved to near perfect for a major telecommunications firm robots saved the company over 18m per year by allowing hundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks nbspppstrongdon’t diss disruptive tech because it’s here to stay —and it’s awesomestrongstrongchatbotsstrong nbsp ppjobseekers are active on social media and other nontraditional channels and we’re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter faster way to connect with qualified candidates thanks to their automated nature chatbots can handle simultaneous candidate inquiries provide realtime responses and conduct initial applicant screenings and because they operate 247 we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and ultimately hireppstronginactionstrong in three months’ time we were able to interview approximately 3000 candidates compared to 966 during the same timeframe without chatbots—saving over 1200 recruiting manhours and reducing the costperhire by 84ppstrongspeech analyticsstrong nbsp ppthis new tool is leading to all kinds of ‘aha’ moments through speech analytics we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information are customers calling about billing technology something else how did the call go was it a good customer experience what could we be doing better nbsp ppstronginactionstrong speech analytics radically enhances our quality assurance model through technology it allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better capabilities identify call trends and themes and help us create even more insanely great customer experiencespnbsp

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/lessons-in-loyalty,"<p>While conducting research for this blog, it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective that loyalty programs are, at their core, focused on driving revenue, but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing.</p> <p>A recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experience.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;That’s why it’s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the customer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point when considering the customer experience is the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs, this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits. </p> <p>Consider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer experience: &nbsp; </p> <h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep it simple and clear</h3> <p>According to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer effort is an important part of building loyalty,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do this, keep these points in mind: &nbsp; </p> <h4><strong>Simple points system</strong></h4> <p>The most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that translate into some type of reward, and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship between points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing.</p> <p>One way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of points, the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However, this system typically works best for businesses that encourage frequent short-term purchases.<sup>3</sup></p> <h4><strong>Set a clear goal, and make it easy to see progress</strong></h4> <p>To prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program, customers must look forward to a clear-cut goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they’ll lose interest.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>A major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of their rewards point balance, and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal. Providing customers with clear and easily accessible methods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort. &nbsp; </p> <p>A recent JD &amp; Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President’s Club were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards programs.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Looking at their mobile apps and how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags behind. </p> <p><img alt="""" src=""/images/default-source/insights/phone_screenshot-768x663.png?sfvrsn=311081a1_0"" height=""663"" class=""size-medium_large wp-image-8015 aligncenter"" width=""768""></p> <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor and control</h3> <p>An excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates retention but can also help ascertain whether your customers feel that the program is too obtuse.</p> <p>Redemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20%, and the average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;If a redemption rate falls below 14%, it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for improvement. &nbsp; </p> <p>Gathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program members, gather info continuously to ensure that the organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort. &nbsp; </p> <h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use data for continuous improvement</h3> <p>Loyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits, such as average transaction amount, most frequently purchased items, and much more.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;This data, combined with customer contact history, provides organizations with the ammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases.

for this blog it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention this makes sense from the perspective that loyalty programs are at their core focused on driving revenue but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishingp pa recent study on retail brands found that 79 of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experiencesup1supnbspthat’s why it’s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the customer experience establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place a good starting point when considering the customer experience is the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand for loyalty programs this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits p pconsider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easytouse and easytounderstand loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also

        ","<p>Generative AI is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more accessible to a wider audience, with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard leading the charge. <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">OpenAI’s ChatGPT set a new record for the fastest-growing consumer application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch.</a> As a global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions, Alorica is already harnessing the power of generative AI to create more personalized brand interactions.</p><p>In today’s competitive business environment, every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers’ needs. To deliver a positive customer experience, it's essential to understand intent, context, and sentiment to provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly. As a Large Learning Model (LLM), generative AI is often used to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the unique ability to be trained on large datasets. By seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with comprehension of massive content repositories, the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant responses that underpin chatbots, virtual assistants and other AI-driven language applications in a powerful way.</p><p>As an LLM, generative AI is a game-changing resource for contact centers delivering CX. Its conversation-generating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power self-service bots, automate email responders, and produce report summarizations. While automated chat responses already help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks, generative AI adds value in other areas, including in-depth analysis of customer interactions. Service organizations can use it to streamline customer service interactions quickly, easily, and accurately, saving significant time and resources. It also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, using this information to adapt their products, services, and processes.</p><p>One of the overlooked benefits of generative AI is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data, such as conversations, chat interactions, and even operating manuals, which is a significant leap forward. This means that previously ""dark data"" can now be resurrected in a meaningful way, providing organizations with valuable intel that they were unable to access before.</p><h5><b>Alorica has taken the lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative AI to enhance customer satisfaction and lifetime value.</b></h5><p><b>For example, Alorica is collaborating with Microsoft and OpenAI on several proof of concepts. Through this partnership, Alorica is using ChatGPT to analyze millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client. The purpose of this initiative is to identify patterns and trends that will enable Alorica and its client to derive actionable insights with exponentially more speed, agility, scalability, consistency, and efficiency.</b></p><p><b></b>By combining ChatGPT’s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with Alorica’s digital-first approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually, the goal is to establish use cases and applications that will transform CX. Its first task is to analyze 50,000 data assets from five years and produce a cohesive report in record time. ChatGPT is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly. This project will uncover every “voice of the customer” more rapidly, precisely, and comprehensively.<b></b></p><p>Generative AI is not just a flashy new toy. It represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve. The dawn of a new era in CX technology and engagement is upon us, and as an industry, we’ve only just scratched the surface. For this reason (and more), Alorica is eager to be at the forefront, harnessing the power of generative AI in its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experience.</p>",pgenerative ai is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more accessible to a wider audience with products like openais chatgpt and googles bard leading the charge a hrefhttpswwwreuterscomtechnologychatgptsetsrecordfastestgrowinguserbaseanalystnote20230201 datasfecimmutableopenai’s chatgpt set a new record for the fastestgrowing consumer application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launcha as a global provider of customer experience cx solutions alorica is already harnessing the power of generative ai to create more personalized brand interactionsppin today’s competitive business environment every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers’ needs to deliver a positive customer experience its essential to understand intent context and sentiment to provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly as a large learning model llm generative ai is often used to perform natural language processing nlp tasks with the unique ability to be trained on large datasets by seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with comprehension of massive content repositories the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant responses that underpin chatbots virtual assistants and other aidriven language applications in a powerful wayppas an llm generative ai is a gamechanging resource for contact centers delivering cx its conversationgenerating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power selfservice bots automate email responders and produce report summarizations while automated chat responses already help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks generative ai adds value in other areas including indepth analysis of customer interactions service organizations can use it to streamline customer service interactions quickly easily and accurately saving significant time and resources it also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior preferences and pain points using this information to adapt their products services and processesppone of the overlooked benefits of generative ai is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data such as conversations chat interactions and even operating manuals which is a significant leap forward this means that previously dark data can now be resurrected in a meaningful way providing organizations with valuable intel that they were unable to access beforeph5balorica has taken the lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative ai to enhance customer satisfaction and lifetime valuebh5pbfor example alorica is collaborating with microsoft and openai on several proof of concepts through this partnership alorica is using chatgpt to analyze millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client the purpose of this initiative is to identify patterns and trends that will enable alorica and its client to derive actionable insights with exponentially more speed agility scalability consistency and efficiencybppbbby combining chatgpt’s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with alorica’s digitalfirst approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually the goal is to establish use cases and applications that will transform cx its first task is to analyze 50000 data assets from five years and produce a cohesive report in record time chatgpt is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly this project will uncover every “voice of the customer” more rapidly precisely and comprehensivelybbppgenerative ai is not just a flashy new toy it represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve the dawn of a new era in cx technology and engagement is upon us and as an industry we’ve only just scratched the surface for this reason and more alorica is eager to be at the forefront harnessing the power of generative ai in its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experiencep

            https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-to-automate-your-contact-center-without-leaving-your-employees-behind
        ","<p>There’s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend that is gaining momentum and a strategy that’s important to explore. But, it’s also important to remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low unemployment and high competition for talent, retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don’t let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage. &nbsp;</p><p>Instead, adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize&nbsp;<strong>what</strong>&nbsp;you will be automating. That’s done by tuning into the&nbsp;<strong>why&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>how&nbsp;</strong>of the automation journey. &nbsp; </p><h5><strong>1. Make employees part of the why.</strong></h5><p>Employee engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you. &nbsp; </p><p>One of the primary reason’s employees leave a company is because they don’t feel valued or challenged.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;A strong foundation is built when employees not only feel valued for their skills, but also for their ability to communicate well, focus on the real issues requiring complex problem solving, and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way. Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead, it’s meant to create more opportunities for them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest. &nbsp; </p><h5><strong>2. Answer “What’s in it for me?”</strong></h5><p>Employees want to know what’s in it for them, especially as fears arise about what automation means for future job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process. &nbsp; </p><p>Make ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily and what prevents true resolution.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Ask what could be automated to improve the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues. Often times, the largest systemic flaws are identified in these meetings. You’ll walk away with a gold mine of information and employees will feel valued, trusted and, most importantly, heard. &nbsp; </p><p>Fact check the feedback against repeat calls, resolution rates, NPS<sup style=""top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"">®</sup> scores and CSAT scores to demonstrate the ROI for the investments needed to correct the issue. Then go forth to develop your action plan. Don’t forget to close the loop – use your regular meetings to share your action plan and progress, ensuring it is understandable to those it will impact the most. &nbsp; </p><h5><strong>3. Create a passion for self-service.</strong></h5><p>Keep employees excited about a self-service culture by cultivating a campaign and infrastructure with them in mind. A few easy checks will ensure you’re doing just that. </p><ol><li>Are you including hands-on classroom training on new applications, with skills verification and proficiency checks?</li><li>What is your strategy for ongoing training when your website, app or other self-service tools are updated?

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/taking-a-bite-out-of-churn-one-customer-at-a-time,"<p>As customers become more empowered to select goods and services that fit best into their lifestyle, it is imperative that businesses work harder to retain the customers they have. The cost of attracting new customers continues to increase, making it harder to grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It’s widely understood that it is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one—5x more!—depending on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers/"">source</a></strong><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and industry.&nbsp;This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score<sup style=""top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"">®</sup> movement. &nbsp; </p> <p>So, we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do that in such a competitive environment? &nbsp; </p> <p>Let’s break it down, shall we? </p> <br> <h5><strong>Listen to your customers’ needs</strong></h5> <p>Take the time to know your customers—really&nbsp;know them. Who are they? What do they really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires, what’s working and what isn’t, and how they feel about their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys, phone marketing, exit interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums. </p> <br> <h5><strong>Act on the data you gather</strong></h5> <p>Change when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve. Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them. Provide alternative solutions where known issues exist. Proactively offer something (a discount, promo item, etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to provide feedback. Furthermore, it’s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback—options should include human interaction (phone or chat) and self-help (IVR, web or social). It’s your willingness and ability to connect with your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer—which directly impacts your ability to retain and grow your market share. </p> <br> <h5><strong>Respect your customers’ time</strong></h5> <p>Each interaction you have with your customers should be natural, organic and personalized. Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists, and they are more likely to respond positively to a real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive audience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers’ needs&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport—explain what you can and will do each step of the way. Ask questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their business, let them get on with their day. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely, over-solicitation of new offerings that don’t fit their needs could push them to a competitor. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>Stay relevant</strong></h5> <p>It hardly needs to be said (but we’re going to say it anyway)—it’s&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline"">critical&nbsp;</span>to understand your customers and your competition. The marketplace is constantly changing, and what customers see, and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers or solutions become available, be sure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid the fate of once&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/7-iconic-brands-no-longer-exist.asp"">iconic brands</a></strong><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;no longer in existence. &nbsp; </p> <p>So, let’s sum it up.

The key to being a lifelong learner is to also be a lifelong listener. If you’re able to really listen, you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the status quo. </p><p>Working her way up in the BPO industry, she started out as an agent and then was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering before she moved into client solutions.

My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and beyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with them, I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers. </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Looking back, did you see yourself reaching a director role?</b><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)""><br>A:</b> Yes, I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward, but I think in life, your priorities change as you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my perspectives widened, my leadership and listening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed.</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn?</b><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)""><br>A:</b> In my life and career, I’ve had to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it’s because I’m female, a minority, my age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use effective communication, and make fact-based recommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect.</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory?

Every one of those things have been a learning experience, building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look at the business from varied perspectives has been positive and has let me make better decisions.</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: What excites you most about what you do at Alorica?</b><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)""><br>A:</b> Technology is progressing to take over tedious activities that allow people to spend their time in areas that provide more value, and to think of solutions for the future.

All was going smoothly, but two weeks prior to the end of new-hire training, the scope of work shifted. Alorica was tasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support, in order to help reduce unnecessary service dispatches.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/social-care-analytics-and-the-retail-customer-experience
        ","<p>“Know your customer” has been a retail rallying cry for the past several decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers’ likely buying behaviors, they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers <em>now</em> face is how to enhance and personalize the customer experience, so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer and the brand—regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship. &nbsp; </p> <p>But let’s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as <em>Social Media</em>. What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV, radio and print as the preferred media source for a growing percentage of the population, and as ‘cord cutters’ continue to rise, advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services, and are being reallocated towards content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices. &nbsp; </p> <p>As these extensive technological changes continue, and growing consumer demand and the ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage, it’s imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock valuable consumer data, including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their experiences, and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care—the efforts of caring for customers using social media—is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers. Marketers, retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their customer journey by providing social media support, yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and quantitative value of their efforts. &nbsp;</p> <p>Retailers are being pushed into social care by engaged, social-savvy consumers who are posting questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming, with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news, is that not all social posts are created equal—they don’t all require a response. Robust listening platforms along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and effective.&nbsp;In addition, while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact, channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a customer asks a question in a channel that isn’t able to support an appropriate response. For example, if a customer asks a question on Twitter, the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry in 140 characters or less. For some context, the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise, a customer may need to share sensitive account information, thus requiring a more private, secure channel such as phone, chat or email. &nbsp; </p> <p>Although channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered, it raises problems for measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately, there are technology platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues. &nbsp; </p> <p>Metrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program. Traditional social media metrics (“likes”, “followers,” etc.) are valuable, but they don’t necessarily provide insight into important areas—like the level of customer satisfaction across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your customer retention strategy. &nbsp; </p> <p>Lastly, consider partnering with your user community. It’s a good idea to deploy YouTube customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z, YouTube can help you provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company’s overall support cost. Avenues for guided self-service, including video FAQs and tutorials, provide a path of great value for your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome—higher satisfaction levels for all customers, and a more strategic deployment of internal resources—both of which can impact your bottom and top lines. &nbsp; </p> <p>Today’s retailers stand at a crossroads—evolve existing practices to meet and exceed the expectations of your customers, or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you in the marketplace. Don’t let customers pass you by—start planning your social care, channel redirection and guided self-service strategy today—because your success depends on it!</p>",p“know your customer” has been a

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/mlba-fundraisers-our-worst-3-omaha-06,"<em>by J. Scott Nebel, Omaha 06</em> <br> While any fundraising event that engages, unifies and raises money is a worthy effort, fundraising is not without its failures and frustrations. So here is ...<strong><br> Part 2</strong> (<span><a title=""MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)"" href=""mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"">click here for Part 1</a>):&nbsp;<strong><em>What Went Wrong…?</em>&nbsp; (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers)</strong></span> <strong><br> Flop Number&nbsp;3: Car Wash</strong> <br> Hose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait, where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash, only we're not really washing anything, so it's more of a ""_"", which I really don't know how to pronounce, but I'm pretty sure a ""_"" doesn't make any money! <br> We have succeeded and failed with car washes, but failure was always a result of&nbsp;the planning and execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes:<br> TIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule more than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick, be pulled into emergency meetings, or get abducted by aliens (Seriously, it's been weeks. Where's Joe!) <br> TIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President of Corporate Suds and Towels, we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out&nbsp;how much staff you will need. <br> <strong>Flop Number 2: Off-Site Events</strong> <br> Off-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work, getting the name Alorica out into the community—it's a win-win, even if you make nothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ... <br> TIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop. Whether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either, but that's still marginally in the ""win"" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the <a title=""MLBA Fundraisers: Our Top 3 (and Worst 3!)"" href=""mlba-fundraisers-our-top-3-and-worst-3/"">Penny War</a>...) <br> TIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you have active engagement across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of a full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my first attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!) <br> <strong>Number 1: Culture Kitchen</strong><em><br> ""Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?""</em> &nbsp;Yup.<em><br> ""Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?""</em>&nbsp; Yup. <br> Pricing is a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof plan. <br> TIP1: I ""math-ed"" and you can, too!&nbsp; Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing:<br> <strong><em>2c/p<br> </em></strong><strong><em>aka Two times the <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">C</span>ost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">P</span>articipants.&nbsp;</em></strong><br> TIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation?&nbsp; Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back in time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around <strong><em>25-33%</em></strong> of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees (at least not when there is a charge... <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">FREE&nbsp;</span></em>food is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!) <br> You'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you try some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up … it’s easier to give change for whole dollars!<br> <strong>To Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four ""P""s:&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>Plan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!)</li> <li>Promote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!)</li> <li>Party with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!)</li> <li>Peanut Butter!

kinks on crossprogram promotion but ensure you have active engagement across all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate a single flyer or email isnt as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication never underestimate the power of a full songanddance number nobody will ever forget that day no matter how

Of the funds collected, more than 6,00 grants have been awarded— totaling in excess of $2.8 million.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-tips-to-strengthen-it-customer-service-response,"<p>While it’s important to deliver consistent client service on a regular basis, it can be difficult to do so without the proper technological infrastructure. As consumer demands continue to shift,&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">customer care solutions</a>&nbsp;teams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons’ needs. While these technologies create a faster, more flexible staff member, they also require special attention in some instances, since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure. &nbsp; </p><p>IT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a&nbsp;<a href=""/industries"">customer relationship management technology</a>&nbsp;system, but in terms of systematic processes, finding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems, they’re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction, among other things. With that in mind, here are four tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue: &nbsp; </p><p><strong>1. Don’t jump to conclusions:</strong>&nbsp;Assuming typically doesn’t get anyone very far, so best practice – especially in the customer service industry – is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It can be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business’s service center, especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before. However, the idea of effective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process:</strong>&nbsp;The parlance of a&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">BPO technical support</a>&nbsp;representative will likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It’s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The way a client describes something may make sense to him or her, but it very well could be the wrong way to&nbsp;describe something from a business standpoint. Alternatively, a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron, otherwise the internal vernacular may confuse the customer at hand. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>3. Manage issues in order of their importance:</strong>&nbsp;In a perfect world, nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team’s IT infrastructure, therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However, since the human element is a constant in the client services equation, there are bound to be mistakes in the process. As a result, management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively, or else the most important issues won’t get taken care of first. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>4. Cover all bases before taking action:</strong>&nbsp;This can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion, so it’s hard not to understand why a&nbsp;<a href=""/news/detail/customer-care/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">contact center service</a>&nbsp;would want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet, it’s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts with the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a longer process, but it will teach reps to double-check, cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed. &nbsp; </p>",pwhile it’s important to deliver consistent client service on a regular basis it can be difficult to do so without the proper technological infrastructure as consumer demands continue to shiftnbspa hrefnewsdetailcustomercare datasfecimmutablecustomer care solutionsanbspteams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons’ needs while these technologies create a faster more flexible staff member they also require special attention in some instances since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure nbsp ppit teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in anbspa hrefindustriescustomer relationship management technologyanbspsystem but in terms of systematic processes finding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game if a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems they’re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction among other things with that in mind here are four tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue nbsp ppstrong1 don’t jump to conclusionsstrongnbspassuming typically doesn’t get anyone very far so best practice – especially in the customer service industry – is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint it can be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business’s service center especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before however the idea of effective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on nbsp ppstrong2 remain attentive throughout the entire processstrongnbspthe parlance of anbspa hrefnewsdetailcustomercare datasfecimmutablebpo technical supportanbsprepresentative will likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern it’s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks the way a client describes something may make sense to him or her but it very well could be the wrong way tonbspdescribe something from a business standpoint alternatively a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron otherwise the internal vernacular may confuse the customer at hand nbsp ppstrong3 manage issues in order of their importancestrongnbspin a perfect world nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team’s it infrastructure therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups however since the human element is a constant in the client services equation there are bound to be mistakes in the process as a result management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively or else the most important issues won’t get taken care of first nbsp ppstrong4 cover all bases before taking actionstrongnbspthis can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion so it’s hard not to understand why anbspa hrefnewsdetailcustomercare datasfecimmutablecontact center serviceanbspwould want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron yet it’s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level an effective troubleshooting process starts with the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all it can be a longer process but it will teach reps to doublecheck cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed nbsp p

But, when it comes down to the moment that’s most impactful for a customer, it usually comes down to their interaction with a customer service agent.</li> <li>The feedback economy shifts the service model on its head. There is less focus on broadcasting why your company is great. The focus is on listening to the customer, understanding their pain points, and creating more systemic changes to address them.</li> <li>There are thousands of avenues for empowered consumers to make their voices heard. You need the right tools to harness all this feedback and take action.</li> <li>Social channels don’t discriminate. Companies have to learn to change their processes, technologies, and products to be responsive. The customers need to be the center of a company’s strategy.</li> <li>Technology is only a piece of what it takes to get the customer service equation right. You need the right judgment and empathy to take action and help your customers.</li> <li>Customer service happens throughout the entire customer journey. The overall user experience is a function of an ecosystem of partners for delivery. Employees, and in some instances, companies need to collaborate to create a great <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/"">customer experience</a>.</li> <li>Policies should be rules or guidelines that empower employees to help the customer instead of hindering service.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Quotes:</strong> </p> <p>“The customer is the center of everything that you do.”</p> <p>“Always put the customer and their voice as your north star in how you think about providing service.”</p> <p>“At the end of the day, it comes down to listening.

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-do-analytics-factor-into-acquiring-retaining-customers
        ","<h3><strong>The Importance of Acquisition and Retention</strong></h3> <p>Let’s start with a couple facts. It’s been shown that: &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>A 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%</li> <li>Brand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers, and 7x more than detractors</li> <li>Companies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value, and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passive</li> </ul> &nbsp; <p>The truth is, many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what’s the solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers, but maintaining the customer relationships you already possess?</p> <p>Simple. Analytics. </p> <h3><strong>It’s Good to Get Analytical.</strong></h3> <p>Analytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at the right time, increase your propensity to connect, convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand. In addition, analytics let companies personalize the customer experience, reducing the need for mass sales pitches or blanket selling. </p> <p>Our extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day, lead demographics and scoring, bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And yet, analytics are practically useless unless you can truly put them to work. &nbsp;</p> <h3><strong>Actionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters</strong></h3> <p><strong></strong>The sad truth is that analytics are often only reported, and not analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities, as potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics). &nbsp;</p> <p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists, predict propensity to connect and increase first-attempt connects, all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%. &nbsp;</p> <h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3> <p>Access to analytics is important, but <em>analyzing</em> the analytics – putting the data to work for you – that’s where the difference is made. It’s all about predictive models that leverage diverse sources of data such as text, survey responses, and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households, which, when coupled with Alorica’s 30 years of experience, allows us to fully analyze and interpret information – and not just merely spit out numbers.</p> <p>That’s how you gain customers. That’s how you <em>keep</em> customers. Simply put, that’s what grows your company. And growing your company is what Alorica is all about. &nbsp;</p>",h3strongthe importance of acquisition and retentionstrongh3 plet’s start with a couple facts it’s been shown that nbspp ul lia 5 increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25li librand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers and 7x more than detractorsli licompanies with greater retention rates account for 75 of that additional value and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passiveli ul nbsp pthe truth is many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers so what’s the solution how can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers but maintaining the customer relationships you already possessp psimple analytics p h3strongit’s good to get analyticalstrongh3 panalytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for analytics allow you to reach the right customers at the right time increase your propensity to connect convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand in addition analytics let companies personalize the customer experience reducing the need for mass sales pitches or blanket selling p pour extensive analytical capabilities track among other metrics time of day lead demographics and scoring bucket reports funneling customers to help drive conversion and number of call attempts and yet analytics are practically useless unless you can truly put them to work nbspp h3strongactionable analytics why analysis mattersstrongh3 pstrongstrongthe sad truth is that analytics are often only reported and not analyzed this leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities as potential sales are lost by continuing to masssell versus targeting preferred demographics nbspp pbut it doesn’t have to be that way data enables companies to build warm lead lists predict propensity to connect and increase firstattempt connects all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 2025 nbspp h3strongthe bottom linestrongh3 paccess to analytics is important but emanalyzingem the analytics – putting the data to work for you – that’s where the difference is made it’s all about predictive models that leverage diverse sources of data such as text survey responses and customer profiles our center of analytical excellence has access to data from over 300 million households which when coupled with alorica’s 30 years of experience allows us to fully analyze and interpret information – and not just merely spit out numbersp pthat’s how you gain customers that’s how you emkeepem customers simply put that’s what grows your company and growing your company is what alorica is all about nbspp

While <a href=""/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">understanding and decoding this group</a> is paramount, there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them.<sup>1</sup> The most important weapon is your employer brand.<br></p><h3><strong>What is an employer brand…and why should you care?</strong></h3><p>As a textbook definition, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">your employer brand</a> is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about you. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes.<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup></sup>It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working environment and culture like? </p><p>The employer brand and <a href=""http://www.recruiting.com/blog/6-steps-building-employee-value-proposition"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">employee value proposition</a>&nbsp;have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more choices than ever before.<sup>3</sup> So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they’ve decided that they won’t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact, in one study, almost <a href=""http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/cc/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">70% of candidates</a>&nbsp;said they wouldn’t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p><p>So how do you create a great employer brand? &nbsp; </p><p>Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It’s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time. &nbsp; </p><h3>Key component #1:&nbsp;<strong>Take time for self-reflection</strong></h3><p>Every company has an identity. &nbsp;It will typically include elements of your brand’s purpose, your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What’s important to your company, your CEO, your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to have)? Is yours a company where people actually <em>want</em> to work? Why or why not? &nbsp; </p><p>This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core elements of your company, warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this. &nbsp; </p><h3>Key component #2:&nbsp;<strong>Authenticity above all else</strong></h3><p>Candidates–particularly millennials–hate liars. Don’t try to be something you’re not. The whole point of this exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a quality match there. As you develop your employer brand, stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that. &nbsp; </p><h3>Key component #3:&nbsp;<strong>Develop a purpose-driven EVP</strong></h3><p>Your Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers <em>and</em> their supervisors; engagement; authentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that? &nbsp; </p><h3>Key component #4:&nbsp;<strong>Become a great storyteller</strong></h3><p>You have a great employer brand and compelling EVP, but don’t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong. In the real world, “if you build it” people will not come. You need to become a great storyteller to capture the attention of millennials and bring them to you. &nbsp; </p><p>There’s a <a href=""http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/secret-sauce-employer-brand/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">“secret sauce” for how do this</a>, and of course, it helps if your employer brand’s voice and creative designs appeal to your target candidates.<sup>5</sup> But, make sure your designs reflect your company, too (see point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready, include them in all components of your talent acquisition strategies and engage millennials where they congregate (e.g., social media). &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>As companies fish in the same millennial talent pool, it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer brand, you can do just that. &nbsp; </p><p>SOURCES </p><ol><li>1.&nbsp;<em>Decoding Millennials</em>, Alorica, 2017. <a href=""/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">https://alorica.com/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/</a>.</li><li>2. <em>CEOs Need to Pay Attention to Employer Branding</em>, Richard Mosley, Harvard Business Review, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding</a>.</li><li>3. <em>6 Steps to Building Your Employee Value Proposition</em>, Recruiting.com,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.recruiting.com/blog/6-steps-building-employee-value-proposition"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">http://www.recruiting.com/blog/6-steps-building-employee-value-proposition</a>.</li><li>4.&nbsp;<em>Employment Cost of a Bad Reputation Survey,</em> A Study by Corporate Responsibility Magazine, CR Magazine, <a href=""http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/cc/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/cc/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf</a>.</li><li>5. <em>Psst...

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/its-all-about-making-an-impact,"<p>Alorica delivers customer service on behalf of the world’s largest and most respected brands, but we are so much more than a leading CX provider. We are a company of people, a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility is to ensure that every Alorican is engaged, inspired and nurtured to succeed. &nbsp; </p><p>As Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer, I don’t take this responsibility lightly. And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: <strong>Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless. Be True</strong>. With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work full-time from our homes, these values have taken on an even greater significance. They’ve kept us united even as we physically work apart, and we’ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many essential businesses—including contact tracing, food delivery and content moderation. &nbsp; </p><p>As a minority-owned business, Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities. It’s why we stand up for those less fortunate, and it’s what led us to launch <strong>TIDE: Together for Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity</strong>. We’ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them. We’ve facilitated respectful, fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism, bias, sexual and gender identity, mental health and more. And through them all, we’ve learned about our people. We’ve listened to their stories. And we’ve grown—together. &nbsp; </p><p>We take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit partner, <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA)</a>, has supported team members around the world in times of crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions, each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities—and to-date, we’ve given out almost <strong>$5M</strong> in grants in six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic, it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities—supporting causes and individuals in need. &nbsp; </p><p>All of these programs are certainly good for the soul—but are they good for the business? In one emphatic word, YES! Our <a href=""/corporate-social-responsibility/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</a> initiatives have had a tremendous effect on Alorica’s ability to hire and retain top talent. We’re committed to Impact Sourcing—through which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities. Giving people the chance to earn a living, support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it’s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing—and so what’s good for the community is also good for the bottom line. &nbsp; </p><p>And it’s not just our people that care about our efforts—our partners do too! Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR, and they want to team up with like-minded corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility align, great partnerships are forged—and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible relationships based on shared values. &nbsp; </p><p>Being insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible, and it’s an honor to lead Alorica’s efforts in serving the common good. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved in a short amount of time, but we’ve only just begun—and there are awesome things to come!</p>",palorica delivers customer service on behalf of the world’s largest and most respected brands but we are so much more than a leading cx provider we are a company of people a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility is to ensure that every alorican is engaged inspired and nurtured to succeed nbsp ppas alorica’s chief culture officer i don’t take this responsibility lightly and i know everything we do starts with our core values strongbe connected be bold be relentless be truestrong with covid19 forcing many of us to work fulltime from our homes these values have taken on an even greater significance they’ve kept us united even as we physically work apart and we’ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many essential businesses—including contact tracing food delivery and content moderation nbsp ppas a minorityowned business alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities it’s why we stand up for those less fortunate and it’s what led us to launch strongtide together for inclusion diversity amp equitystrong we’ve created regional tide teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them we’ve facilitated respectful fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism bias sexual and gender identity mental health and more and through them all we’ve learned about our people we’ve listened to their stories and we’ve grown—together nbsp ppwe take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another our nonprofit partner a hrefhttpslivesbetterorg datasfecimmutablemaking lives better with alorica mlbaa has supported team members around the world in times of crisis instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities—and todate we’ve given out almost strong5mstrong in grants in six different countries over the course of the pandemic it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities—supporting causes and individuals in need nbsp ppall of these programs are certainly good for the soul—but are they good for the business in one emphatic word yes our a hrefcorporatesocialresponsibility datasfecimmutablecorporate social responsibility csra initiatives have had a tremendous effect on alorica’s ability to hire and retain top talent we’re committed to impact sourcing—through which we support economicallydisadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities giving people the chance to earn a living support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it’s all about people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing—and so what’s good for the community is also good for the bottom line nbsp ppand it’s not just our people that care about our efforts—our partners do too many of our clients also make strong commitments to csr and they want to team up with likeminded corporations when culture and views on social responsibility align great partnerships are forged—and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible relationships based on shared values nbsp ppbeing insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible and it’s an honor to lead alorica’s efforts in serving the common good i’m incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved in a short amount of time but we’ve only just begun—and there are awesome things to comep

Within only days, we’ve successfully transitioned <em>thousands </em>of agents to an at-home environment—and more are coming online each day!

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/risk-management-blog,"<p>On any given day, 3.5 billion people are online<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;worldwide—and considering the global population is 7.7 billion, that’s a whole lot of people interacting and transacting worldwide. </p><p>Given the proliferation of mobile phones—in the United States alone, there are 106 mobile phones per 100 people—and the sustained popularity of social media websites like Facebook and Instagram, getting online has never been easier.</p><p>And that’s good news and bad news for customers and corporations.&nbsp; </p><h5><b>More People, More Problems</b></h5><p>With so many people online, with multiplatform access 24/7/365, the potential for serious risk has increased exponentially. Online attacks take place every 39 seconds; and a staggering 59% of U.S. teens have been cyberbullied or threatened online<sup>2</sup>. In just the past year alone, 69% of people have experienced online risks, including cyberbullying, hate speech, and threats of violence<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>But it’s not just people who are at risk—over 55% of companies reported an increase in fraud-related losses<sup>4</sup>.&nbsp;Companies also suffer regulatory and financial penalties from data breaches, from the 2014 data breach that cost Home Depot $179 million to Target’s more recent $18.5M payout in 2017<sup>5</sup>.</p><p><font color=""inherit"" size=""-1""></font>Social media companies have found themselves particularly liable in recent years.

Bearing in mind that approximately one in five customers would stop shopping with retailers whose data was hacked and stolen, online risks can have devastating consequences to a company’s bottom line, from the largest big-box retailer to the local boutique.</p><p>Trust &amp; Safety strategies—of which content moderation is an essential tool—can help keep company information accurate and customers safe, even in an ever-changing, crowded online landscape.</p><h5><b>Understanding Legal and Reputational Risks (and How to Prevent Them)</b></h5><p>With so much at stake, companies need to prioritize risk mitigation. And to effectively meet the expectations of consumers, employees, and investors, that means adopting effective risk management programs based on actionable insights.</p><p>But how can companies determine what their risks are, let alone know how to adopt formal programs that touch every aspect of their organizations?</p><p>To help guide companies towards successful risk management efforts, we hosted a webinar dedicated to assessing organizational legal and reputational risks for actionable insights, featuring Adam Dorfman, VP of Product at Reputation.com, Joe Buggy, Alorica’s Head of Trust &amp; Safety, and Harry Folloder, SVP Chief Digital Officer at Alorica.</p><p>The spirited, roundtable discussion covered a wealth of information, from explaining the nuances of assessing risk and best practices to AI’s role in reputation management. </p><p>Key takeaways included: </p><ul type=""disc"" style=""margin-left: 30px""><li><b>Legal vs. reputational:</b> As exemplified by Home Depot and Target, legal risks can include lawsuits, judgements, and financial harm; reputational risks include the erosion of trust and customer losses. </li><li data-list=""0"" data-level=""1""><b>Proactive risk assessment</b>: Companies that regularly conduct risk assessments can stay one step ahead; this means seeking out customer feedback versus waiting for negative content to flourish online.

Because after 30 years in the biz, I can say with certainty that YOU are your best advocate, and you have the power to make things happen for yourself.</p> <p>When I first started out as a call center agent in my 20’s, I didn’t know it would take me to where I am today—the President of North America and Europe Operations for <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/"">one of the largest digital CX providers in the world</a>. But I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new, kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example and lead in the same way. So, don’t wait for someone to come tap you. Never say “no” to a chance to learn more skills. Make mistakes, learn from them, and move on. As I often say, “get over it.” You never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these things. Most importantly, don’t follow a career path; build the one that’s meant for you.</p> <p>This month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias—the theme celebrated around the world for International Women’s Day. Furthering <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion"">diversity and inclusion</a>&nbsp;is, and should be, a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do, it enhances our business, company culture, and especially our people. At Alorica, we even have the numbers to prove it—our female population has grown since last year with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that, but as the largest certified and award-winning minority-owned BPO, we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce to 71%. Why are these facts important? Because strong representation of groups, such as women and minorities, matter to our employees, our clients and our customers—even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as a company, we are making progress. There’s much work to be done, but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction.</p> <p>As we continue Women’s History Month, I’d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion, sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change. These qualities, which have sometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness, actually demonstrate our strength. We aren’t afraid to show these skills with conviction, strong execution and thoughtful leadership, and sometimes wearing bright-red heels. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE…watch me!</p> <p>Read the original post at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://bit.ly/3IsgqKP""></a><a href=""https://bit.ly/3IsgqKP"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bit.ly/3IsgqKP</a> </p>",pstrongreshared fromstrong a hrefhttpsbitly3isgqkp targetblank relnofollowcolleen beers’ linkedinap pit’s women’s history month y’allp pas a mother of six wife of one and woman among millions if i can give any advice to all the ladies out there it is to lead by example i’m so grateful to work at a company like alorica where i’m personally encouraged to be bold and my teams run with it when i challenge them to do the same because after 30 years in the biz i can say with certainty that you are your best advocate and you have the power to make things happen for yourselfp pwhen i first started out as a call center agent in my 20’s i didn’t know it would take me to where i am today—the president of north america and europe operations for a hrefhttpswwwaloricacomone of the largest digital cx providers in the worlda but i saw others shatter the status quo before me and certainly after me by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new kinda scary and bigger opportunities i decided to follow that example and lead in the same way so don’t wait for someone to come tap you never say “no” to a chance to learn more skills make mistakes learn from them and move on as i often say “get over it” you never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these things most importantly don’t follow a career path build the one that’s meant for youp pthis month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to breakthebias—the theme celebrated around the world for international women’s day furthering a hrefhttpswwwaloricacomdiversityequityandinclusiondiversity and inclusionanbspis and should be a top priority for us all besides being the right thing to do it enhances our business company culture and especially our people at alorica we even have the numbers to prove it—our female population has grown since last year with now 62 of our global workforce made up of women not only that but as the largest certified and awardwinning minorityowned bpo we have also increased the number of minorities within our us workforce to 71 why are these facts important because strong representation of groups such as women and minorities matter to our employees our clients and our customers—even more so now as we look toward the future of work and it matters to me that as a company we are making progress there’s much work to be done but we are taking meaningful steps in the right directionp pas we continue women’s history month i’d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special how much we care as well as our passion sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change these qualities which have sometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness actually demonstrate our strength we aren’t afraid to show these skills with conviction strong execution and thoughtful leadership and sometimes wearing brightred heels we are unstoppable…watch mep pread the original post atnbspa hrefhttpsbitly3isgqkpaa hrefhttpsbitly3isgqkp targetblank relnofollowhttpsbitly3isgqkpa p

I have my bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and a master’s degree in Project Management. I started at Alorica on the frontlines for a global communications client in 2009. With no prior contact center experience, I was nervous about not meeting expectations, but with a lot of learning and passion for what I do, I won the site Agent of the Year award the following year! This was a huge milestone for my professional career, opening doors to Quality Assurance and Trainer roles. With support from my mentors, in 2018, I became the Onboarding Specialist for Panama, and was recently assigned to add Uruguay to my responsibilities too. I’m also a Culture Champion for my site and a proud member of the MLBA Juan Diaz chapter. &nbsp;</p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>What professional advice can you give to employees who are just starting out? <br></b></font> Here are my top three tips: </p><ol><li>Be yourself!

If it wasn´t for their hard work, I would have never become who I am today. My family will always be my biggest motivation. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful? <br></b></font> Yes, I will always be thankful to all my Trainers, Supervisors, Operation Managers, and my current Direct Manager, Samson Seelan, who has opened my eyes to new opportunities. I’ll be forever grateful for their guidance and I can’t thank them enough for their trust and encouragement. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Can you tell us future goals for yourself, your team or the company? <br></b></font> My goal is to keep inspiring others and to champion a workplace full of insanely great opportunities.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/inclusive-culture-diverse-workforce,"<p>As globalization continues to reshape the way businesses operate, workforce is becoming increasingly more diverse, bringing in a unique perspective of innovative thinking and cultural expertise. But to attract and retain this diverse talent, we need to focus on creating a culture of inclusivity that encourages individuality. Here are some of the benefits of being part of a global company with an inclusive mindset.&nbsp;</p><h6><b>1. Exploring new markets with confidence&nbsp;</b></h6><p>We are in the era where global presence has become a defining element of success. A diverse talent pool enables companies to harness the cultural knowledge of their employees, thereby understanding the local nuances that are an integral part of consumer behaviors and preferences. This helps brands penetrate new markets effectively and stay ahead of anticipated risks while exploring new opportunities. Our operational footprint across NA, APAC, LATAM and EMEA enable us to best support our customers worldwide with&nbsp;<b>#LimitlessPossibilities</b></p><h6><b>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;</b> <b>Empowering growth</b> </h6><p><i>Employees want to do their best work for leaders they trust and respect.</i> An inclusive leadership team is a key selling point for recruiting best-in-class talent and boosting a company’s reputation as an employer of choice. Employees excel in their performance when they feel encouraged to be their true selves in their workplace, and when they see diversity within their leadership team. Alorica is proud to be a certified diverse supplier with strong minority and female representation around the world. Last year, we promoted 5,000 employees globally and more than half were women. We were also specifically recognized earlier this year for our Achievement in Promoting &amp; Developing Women. <b>#EnhancedPerformance</b><br></p><h6><b>3. Supporting communities</b></h6><p><i>Making lives better starts with individuals but extends much farther than that. </i>Inclusivity goes beyond workplace dynamics. By providing opportunities to local employees from all walks of life—different ages, ethnicities, genders, interests, skills, education—to interact with, solve problems for customers, and grow professionally, companies have a positive ripple effect that impacts communities. This is seen through job creation, economic development, corporate social responsibility contributions and more. As an example,&nbsp; as part of our skilling program in India, we also hire undergraduates and offer extended skills training for career advancement. <b>#PassionatePeople</b></p><p>I can confidently say that one of Alorica’s top differentiators is our people and the corporate culture we’re building together. As we expand our footprint, we remain committed to fostering inclusivity across the teams we support and in collaboration with our fellow colleagues around the world and by doing so, we’re making our Brand Promise come true—Passion.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/chat-with-our-chatbot-the-future-of-recruitment,"<p>The Oxford dictionary defines a chatbot as 'a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.' As is often the case with new technology, many initial chatbots were created for fun, but they’re now being used to enhance the workplace, particularly in HR departments. How you ask? Job interviews can be incredibly stressful for applicants. Chatbots provide a level of comfort and, ironically, emotional distance that can promote efficient and relaxed conversations. Recruitment chatbots can stage initial interviews that are direct, friendly, and minimally intimidating. It’s also simply a better, faster and easier way to connect with qualified candidates. This is a win-win for both applicants and HR teams. &nbsp; </p><p>At Alorica, we have been testing this method of recruitment in the Philippines by embedding the technology onto the Alorica Philippines Facebook page, conducting screenings via Facebook Messenger. To measure the effectiveness of this method, the technology had to solve the following challenges: maximize online recruiting channels; generate inactive leads; and reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads. In the span of just three months, the results have already been overwhelmingly positive! During the testing period, 3,088 candidates were interviewed, compared to 966 during the same period a year prior. There was a savings of more than 1,200 recruiting man hours and the cost per hire reduced by 84 percent. Additionally, online channel conversion rate was up to 14-16 percent compared to traditional channels at 4-6 percent. &nbsp; </p><p>To sum it up, chatbots have completely changed the way Alorica thinks about recruiting. By implementing the technology, we have not only saved money and man hours, but allowed us to connect with qualified candidates who resonated with this recruitment strategy. It just goes to show, the trick to getting face time is a little screen time. &nbsp; </p><p>Alorica is one of the biggest outsourcing employers in the region with 17 sites strategically located across metro Manila and provincial regions.

        ","<p class=""p1"">Recent health care regulations have made it difficult for sales reps and marketing personnel to meet with doctors on an individual basis. ""No-see"" and ""hard to see"" have become industry buzzwords in regards to medical practitioners since securing face time with them has become a challenge. As physicians - and fluid regulations - continue to restrict access to outside reps, the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with patients and less time being solicited.</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p4"">According to a study by Doctors.net.uk,&nbsp;<a title=""52 percent of the more than 1,000"" href=""http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><span class=""s1"">52 percent of the more than 1,000</span></a><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;general practitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week, while just 26 percent only saw one rep in the same time period. No-see doctors are impacting the medical field in a way that is negative for big pharmaceutical companies, but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps, they can focus more on patient health. A general lack of time was cited as the No. 1 reason why doctors don't see sales reps anymore, with 38 percent of respondents saying they were too busy to meet with sales executives. Another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice policy.</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p4""><strong>No-see doctors mean industry wide changes</strong> <br>This shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry, not just sales and marketing reps. Patients are beneficiaries of no-see doctors because they see more individual attention, but on the other hand, practices aren't able to take in as many patients as they used to, hence limiting business to a certain extent. On the back end of operations, doctors now have to manually enter patient information into electronic health record databases and submit prescriptions themselves, so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a result, according to Clark Ridge, vice president of client health care services at Alorica.</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p3"">""The level of accuracy, receiving greater scrutiny, I think you're just saying spend a little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right,"" Ridge said. ""To a doctor, though, it's had a negative impact on their ability to generate revenue because it's reduced the number of people they're able to see.""</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p3"">Ridge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies, such as reimbursement rates determined by patient satisfaction scoring, the trickle-down effect of no-see and hard-to-see doctors may be more wide-sweeping than first thought. No longer are general physician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long periods of time before they see a doctor.</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p4""><strong>Outsourced assistance could prove useful</strong> Now that doctors are spending more time with each patient, chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized experience. On the front end of doctor's office visits, practices have been implementing streamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments. For example, individuals can now go online and book a time to visit their physician, and when they show up for their consultations, they can check-in using an automated kiosk. Although the adoption of the electronic sign-in has been slow, Ridge said it could greatly benefit the practices that implement such systems.</p>&nbsp; <p class=""p3"">""To really take advantage of efficiency, outsourcing some of that interaction to a group of individuals that don't have to be on-site and can capture the information is a much less costly alternative,"" he said. ""Where completeness and accuracy are key, outsourcing is a great option.""</p>&nbsp; <hr><p class=""p3""><strong>SOURCES</strong></p><p class=""p3"">1<br>http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566</p>",p classp1recent health care regulations have made it difficult for sales reps and marketing personnel to meet with doctors on an individual basis nosee and hard to see have become industry buzzwords in regards to medical practitioners since securing face time with them has become a challenge as physicians and fluid regulations continue to restrict access to outside reps the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with patients and less time being solicitedpnbsp p classp4according to a study by doctorsnetuknbspa title52 percent of the more than 1000 hrefhttpwwwpmlivecomblogsdigitalintelligencearchive2012aug2012ukdoctorspharmasalesrepsdigital418566 targetblank relnoopener noreferrer datasfecimmutablespan classs152 percent of the more than 1000spanasup1supnbspgeneral practitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week while just 26 percent only saw one rep in the same time period nosee doctors are impacting the medical field in a way that is negative for big pharmaceutical companies but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps they can focus more on patient health a general lack of time was cited as the no 1 reason why doctors dont see sales reps anymore with 38 percent of respondents saying they were too busy to meet with sales executives another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice policypnbsp p classp4strongnosee doctors mean industry wide changesstrong brthis shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry not just sales and marketing reps patients are beneficiaries of nosee doctors because they see more individual attention but on the other hand practices arent able to take in as many patients as they used to hence limiting business to a certain extent on the back end of operations doctors now have to manually enter patient information into electronic health record databases and submit prescriptions themselves so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a result according to clark ridge vice president of client health care services at aloricapnbsp p classp3the level of accuracy receiving greater scrutiny i think youre just saying spend a little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right ridge said to a doctor though its had a negative impact on their ability to generate revenue because its reduced the number of people theyre able to seepnbsp p classp3ridge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies such as reimbursement rates determined by patient satisfaction scoring the trickledown effect of nosee and hardtosee doctors may be more widesweeping than first thought no longer are general physician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long periods of time before they see a doctorpnbsp p classp4strongoutsourced assistance could prove usefulstrong now that doctors are spending more time with each patient chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized experience on the front end of doctors office visits practices have been implementing streamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments for example individuals can now go online and book a time to visit their physician and when they show up for their consultations they can checkin using an automated kiosk although the adoption of the electronic signin has been slow ridge said it could greatly benefit the practices that implement such systemspnbsp p classp3to really take advantage of efficiency outsourcing some of that interaction to a group of individuals that dont have to be onsite and can capture the information is a much less costly alternative he said where completeness and accuracy are key outsourcing is a great optionpnbsp hrp classp3strongsourcesstrongpp classp31brhttpwwwpmlivecomblogsdigitalintelligencearchive2012aug2012ukdoctorspharmasalesrepsdigital418566p

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/outsourcing-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-company,"<p>In 2015, <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/"">over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced</a><sup>1</sup>. It’s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources, costs are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren’t generally available internally. &nbsp; </p> <p>Top providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution? &nbsp; </p> <p>Read on, dear friends. Read on. &nbsp; </p> <h3>Six Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense</h3> &nbsp; <h4>1. You want to retain customers.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>Your current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain – and improve – an already exceptional level of service. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions – chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not yet been considered). &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4>2. You want to acquire new customers.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>Bringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>While focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes – as it turns out, we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent profile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind – companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see, on average, a <a href=""http://aberdeen.com/research/8675/ra-omni-channel-experience/content.aspx"">9.5% increase in annual revenue</a><sup>2</sup>. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4>3. Specialized training requires detailed education.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>Certain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there’s just too much for one trainer to know – but additional coaching can’t be supported by your in-house team. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>With a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4>4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>High-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don’t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>BPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar, work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions. We excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you’re always staffed with the most qualified talent. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4>5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>As your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast – and thoughtful – solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses the ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>A BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return to focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4>You don’t have all the tech you need.</h4> &nbsp; <h5><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h5> <p>It’s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel, you’re missing out on opportunities to enhance customer experience and loyalty. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5> <p>BPOs have deep experience with analytics – going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels – voice, email, chat, text, video and social media – customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>***</strong> <br> Your company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values. Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless, blended partnership that benefits both sides. <br> Reach out to us any time, and let’s talk about how Alorica can make a win-win situation happen for

            https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-microlearning-led-to-a-96-compliance-rating-for-a-major-retail-pharmacy-provider
        ","<p>As a result of the average attention span being reduced to a mere eight seconds, people today are accustomed to finding an answer from a quick search. This is where microlearning comes in – it meets this expectation of consuming information, while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way of teaching and delivering content in small bursts, microlearning has been a key success factor for our agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider. &nbsp;</p> <p>Managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, this pharmacy provider began to experience some challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant, ranging from financial loss to medication abuse, and in this highly-regulated industry, it was simply unacceptable. To fix the problem, Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved process compliance, but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it, microlearning. &nbsp; </p> <p>Instead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation, we implemented microlearning — where we created a customized, brief, 10-minute video allowing agents to understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so, this helped close the culture gap to better align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program, we began collecting data on the effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves – the compliance rating improved to as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving — with an average of four training hours per full-time employee. &nbsp; </p> <p>Thanks to this new training method, the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information, while encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore, these microlearnings were cost-effective, resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral, salary for trainers, etc.). &nbsp; </p> <p>We know your business has unique customer needs and we’re here to make sure our agents who provide customer service on your behalf are fully informed and engaged to make lives better, one interaction at a time.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/Rethink-Trust-and-Safety,"<div><p>As America was lurching towards economic instability earlier this year, Everest Group analysts published <i>Rethinking Trust and Safety: Six Strategies for Enterprises to Convert the Recession into an Opportunity</i>, a series of recommendations to help companies navigate uncertain times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Their recommendations included multiple areas in Alorica’s wheelhouse, including:&nbsp; </p></div><div><div><ul style=""margin-left: 60px""><li><b>Considering outsourcing as an option. </b>As Everest Group’s analysts observed, outsourcing is more cost-effective for companies no matter the economic climate. Outsourcing Trust &amp; Safety initiatives, including content moderation and content management, empowers multi-dimensional, multilingual content moderation at scale—something we, as a veteran BPO industry leader, can easily attest to. As we’ve found, by acting as an extension of a client’s business, we’ve been able to provide seamless support while improving the customer experience without incurring risks for our clients. &nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></div><div><ul style=""margin-left: 60px""><li><b></b><b>Identify the most viable shoring mix. </b>Going offshore (and nearshore) for Trust &amp; Safety efforts makes dollars and sense per Everest Group’s analysis. As they note, even large tech firms have been shifting their content management and related needs to cost-effective locations in APAC and LATAM. In our experience, by leveraging our global workforce and delivery models, including work-at-home, hybrid, and gig workforce solutions, clients can empower safe spaces online, as well as maximize ROI in any economic climate.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></div></div><div><div><ul style=""margin-left: 60px""><li><b>Leverage alternative talent models for non-sensitive work types within Trust &amp; Safety. </b>Having a diverse workforce mix makes content moderation and other Trust &amp; Safety initiatives manageable; and, as Everest Group rightly notes, hybrid workforces featuring full-time and gig workers have become increasingly common in the post-Covid-19 landscape. Outsourcing optimized, global workforces like Alorica’s empowers companies to safeguard online communities with ease; we also invest heavily in our employee wellbeing to ensure that our talent is always up to the task.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></div><div><ul style=""margin-left: 60px""><li><b>Adopt a pragmatic approach to digital investments.</b> Large technology firms often partner with third-party service providers to leverage their talent pools and harness new technologies. Outsourcing, as Everest Group illustrates, makes it possible for companies of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technologies to improve content moderation and customer support simultaneously. Alorica’s clients and their customers enjoy the latest technology and optimal support without impacting their bottom lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></div><div><p>But this is just the beginning, per Everest Group, because outsourcing Trust &amp; Safety also helps reduce attrition, creates more resilient workforces, and reduces portfolio risks—all things we couldn’t agree with more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b style=""background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/the-key-to-compliance-a-microlearning-case-study,"<p>While managing millions of customer prescriptions daily, a major retail pharmacy provider began to experience some slipping in prescription fulfillment compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The client came to us in search of an effective learning intervention, and we presented them with the concept of microlearning. &nbsp; </p> <p>With a group that was skeptical of new approaches to training, you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. Challenge accepted. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p> <ul> <li>Introduce ‘microlearning’ to revolutionize training protocols</li> <br> <li>Boost KPI scores</li> <br> <li>Win over a skeptical client</li> </ul> &nbsp; <p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong></p> <ul> <li>Pilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by as much as 62%</li> <br> <li>Cost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee</li> <br> <li>Microlearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program</li> </ul> <p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>Convince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day.</strong> <br> This one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site’s team was made up of Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance. &nbsp; </p> <p>Furthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning. &nbsp; </p> <p>Challenge accepted. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>Better Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores.</strong> <br> Instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention <em>marathons</em>, we championed <strong>microlearning</strong>: a short, animated video that focused on client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client expectations. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>Microlearning Makes Its Mark.</strong> <br> Thanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions. Furthermore, microlearning is cost-effective, minimizing the need for traditional classroom training and ultimately cutting development costs by 50%.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",pwhile managing millions of customer prescriptions daily a major retail pharmacy provider began to experience some slipping in prescription fulfillment compliancenbspnbspthe client came to us in search of an effective learning intervention and we presented them with the concept of microlearning nbsp p pwith a group that was skeptical of new approaches to training you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning challenge accepted nbsp p pstrongthe challengestrongp ul liintroduce ‘microlearning’ to revolutionize training protocolsli br liboost kpi scoresli br liwin over a skeptical clientli ul nbsp pstrongthe outcomestrongp ul lipilotsite process compliance hit 96 to goal 60 days after training besting nonpilot sites by as much as 62li br licost savings on average we reduced retraining time by as much as 80 per fulltime employeeli br limicrolearning content was integrated right from the start in the newhire training programli ul pstrongthe challengestrongstrongstrongp pstrongstrongstrongconvince the client boost the scores win the daystrong br this one was a bit tricky we were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention more than 95 of the pilot site’s team was made up of millennials and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance nbsp p pfurthermore our mission also entailed boosting kpi scores toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning nbsp p pchallenge accepted nbsp p pstrongthe solutionstrongp pstrongstrongstrongbetter technology better retention better scoresstrong br instead of traditional classroom retraining intervention emmarathonsem we championed strongmicrolearningstrong a short animated video that focused on clientspecific goals in this case the importance of improving compliance brief animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client expectations nbsp p pstrongthe outcomestrongp pstrongstrongstrongmicrolearning makes its markstrong br thanks to the new training method the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods playing a major role in its success is microlearning’s digestible nature these short videos help agents retain 20 more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions furthermore microlearning is costeffective minimizing the need for traditional classroom training and ultimately cutting development costs by 50p nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp

My transition into a leadership role was tough. So, I went ahead and learned how I thought best. I made sure to sit next to a genius workforce person, so I could learn terminology, computations and how to optimize tools. I learned from leaders and my peers around me, and never stopped inquiring. I watched and I asked—and I still do that to this day. &nbsp; I always look at everyone as my equal, no matter the title or experience.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/3-principles-of-social-media-customer-service,"<p>Multichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use, it's become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that <a title=""99 percent of brands surveyed"" href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">99 percent of brands surveyed</a><sup>1</sup> were on Twitter, while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account, Social Media Examiner said, citing Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand. &nbsp; </p> <p>With that in mind, here are three principles to consider about social media customer service: &nbsp; </p> <p>1. <strong>Different channel, same service:</strong> Just because there's a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted, the end goal is to directly address any question, comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue, a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However, if a customer makes a lighthearted comment, then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive channel. &nbsp; </p> <p>2. <strong>The quicker the response, the better:</strong> The average response time for respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours, with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day, a timely response is best practice when it comes to real­time communication. A Lithium Technologies study found that <a title=""53 percent of consumers"" href=""http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">53 percent of consumers</a><sup>2</sup> expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour, and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If brands neglect to respond, consumers take punishing actions. For example, 60 percent of respondents said they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly. &nbsp; </p> <p>3. <strong>A social persona should be passive:</strong> When it comes to customer response, companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However, the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive, if anything. There are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores, but that doesn't give it a free pass to negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition. </p> <hr> <p><strong>SOURCES</strong> </p> <p>1 &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/"">http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/</a> </p> <p>2 &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly"">http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly</a></p> &nbsp;",pmultichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use its become an industry norm a study conducted by social analytics company simply measured found that a title99 percent of brands surveyed hrefhttpwwwsocialmediaexaminercomexceptionalcustomerserviceontwitter targetblank relnoopener99 percent of brands surveyedasup1sup were on twitter while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account social media examiner said citing simply measured statistics its becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand nbsp p pwith that in mind here are three principles to consider about social media customer service nbsp p p1 strongdifferent channel same servicestrong just because theres a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesnt mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media while the interaction can be more lighthearted the end goal is to directly address any question comment or concern that a consumer may have depending on the severity of the issue a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner however if a customer makes a lighthearted comment then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well the objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive channel nbsp p p2 strongthe quicker the response the betterstrong the average response time for respondents in the simply measured study was five hours with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour although its difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day a timely response is best practice when it comes to real­time communication a lithium technologies study found that a title53 percent of consumers hrefhttpwwwlithiumcomcompanynewsroompressreleases2013consumerswillpunishbrandsthatfailtorespondontwitterquickly targetblank relnoopener53 percent of consumersasup2sup expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint if brands neglect to respond consumers take punishing actions for example 60 percent of respondents said theyd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly nbsp p p3 stronga social persona should be passivestrong when it comes to customer response companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible however the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive if anything there are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores but that doesnt give it a free pass to negatively react an intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition p hr pstrongsourcesstrong p p1 nbspa hrefhttpwwwsocialmediaexaminercomexceptionalcustomerserviceontwitterhttpwwwsocialmediaexaminercomexceptionalcustomerserviceontwittera p p2 nbspa hrefhttpwwwlithiumcomcompanynewsroompressreleases2013consumerswillpunishbrandsthatfailtorespondontwitterquicklyhttpwwwlithiumcomcompanynewsroompressreleases2013consumerswillpunishbrandsthatfailtorespondontwitterquicklyap nbsp

        ","<p>Security sure isn’t what it used to be! If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it’s that businesses need to seriously assess their data security. Now more than ever, utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft, with hackers taking advantage of lax security standards. &nbsp; </p><p>Physical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company, particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers’ data is an essential component of providing top-notch customer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security, it’s important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can be used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques. &nbsp; </p><p>When selecting an outsourcing partner, here are three considerations your utility company should keep in mind: </p><h3><strong>Is your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant?</strong></h3><p>Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience), or you are <em>not</em> PCI compliant in-house, it’s critically important that your outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant. &nbsp; </p><p>There are, however, varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification, but rather, tout “self-assessment”—which essentially means that they may not have been independently assessed, nor approved, by leading credit card providers. &nbsp; </p><p>Be sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer: </p><ul><li>Is the outsourcing partner PCI compliant?</li><br><li>If yes, has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), or are they self-assessed?</li><br><li>Is the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list?</li></ul><p>Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>PCI Security Standard’s website</strong></a><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and view their list of certified companies. &nbsp; </p><h3><strong>Can your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data?</strong></h3><p>In 2013,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/frontline/2014/07/07/payment-card-data-isnt-the-only-lucrative-loot-in-a-data-breach/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>45 percent of data thefts</strong></a><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;involved non-payment card data. Protecting your customers’ payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers’ other personal data vulnerable. &nbsp; </p><p>Remember—it’s not just payment data at risk, so it’s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry like utilities, customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account number, phone number, address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number. &nbsp; </p><p>If non-payment data is breached, it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012, nearly 2 million customers of two&nbsp;<a href=""http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/1986D5ECA1917A8A8525798E005F81DD/$File/pr12007.pdf?OpenElement"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>New York-based utility companies</strong></a><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;had personal data such as their social security numbers, birthdates and other account information exposed. Since then, the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data—payment and non-payment—ask your outsourcing partner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected. &nbsp; </p><h3><strong>Does your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout the customer journey?</strong></h3><p>You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures, but it’s also important to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. &nbsp; Consider questions like these: </p><ul><li>Do your customers have the same experience with your payment processing partner as they do with your own representatives?</li><br><li>How much control do you have over these interactions?</li><br><li>Is your partner committed to providing an&nbsp;<strong><a href=""/outcomes/actionable-insights/alorica-analytics"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">exceptional customer experience</a></strong><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;every time?</li><br><li>Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS<sup style=""top: -0.3em; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom"">®</sup> and customer satisfaction outcomes?</li></ul><p>Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it’s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><strong>Harvard Business Review</strong></a><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive experiences. You need to be certain you’re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions with your outsourcing partner! &nbsp; </p><p>Selecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It’s about securing your customer’s data—all of it—and ensuring that every interaction with your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind when choosing your partner, you’ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that’s truly win-win. </p><hr><p><strong>SOURCES</strong> </p><p>1 &nbsp;<a

simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can be used to breach multifactor authentication techniques nbsp ppwhen selecting an outsourcing partner here are three

outsourcing partner is certified pci compliant nbsp ppthere are however varying levels of pci compliance many companies claiming to be pci compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification but rather tout “selfassessment”—which essentially means that they may not have been independently assessed nor approved by leading credit card providers nbsp ppbe sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of pci compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer pulliis the outsourcing partner pci compliantlibrliif yes has their compliance been certified by

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/what-makes-a-company-a-great-place-to-work,"<p>The company you work for matters; oftentimes we spend more time working with our colleagues than even seeing our friends and family. As I reflect on my last 20+ years working as a global Talent Acquisition leader, I've come to realize that the concept of an ideal workplace varies greatly from person to person. It hinges on factors like our personal goals, age, interests, location, financial situation and more. Job seekers’ preferences can shift daily, but there's one constant thread that unites us. Regardless of our job title or experience level, we all seek out companies that foster a culture of support, growth and inclusion.</p><p>While there's no one-size-fits-all way to tell if a company prioritizes its employees, there are a few qualities that all the best companies embody.</p><h6><b>A Diverse Workforce</b> </h6><p>Any company can say DEI (Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion) is important to them, but you want to look for employers that can give concrete examples of their commitment. Do they have diverse representation across their workforce? What about within their leadership team? There are many benefits to a strong DEI-focused culture; it allows employees to feel comfortable being themselves and confident to do their best work. According to the McKinsey report <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><i>Delivering through Diversity</i></a>, diverse companies attract top talent and have better financial performance. At Alorica, a global CX provider, diversity is in our roots. We are the largest certified minority-owned BPO and as an example, 60% of our workforce is made up of women. In fact, we won an award for our Achievement in Promoting and Developing Women.&nbsp; We are also proud to be awarded as a <a href=""https://www.alorica.com/news/detail/alorica-wins-top-place-to-work-for-its-dei-focused-culture-grassroots-philanthropy-and-employee-development-opportunities"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Top Place to Work by Ragan Awards</a> for our DEI initiatives. <br></p><h6><b>Healthy Work-Life Balance</b></h6><p>When you're considering potential employers, work-life balance should be non-negotiable. Achieving a healthy balance between your personal and professional life has a significant impact on your mental and physical well-being. Research from <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906876/full#:~:text=Previous%20research%20found%20that%20employee,performance%20in%20a%20medical%20context."" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Frontiers Media</a> has shown that when there's a conflict between work and life, it can lead to lower productivity and performance, potentially holding back your career. </p><p>At Alorica, we offer a standard five-day work week and organize free health talk sessions as well as health checkup camps. Through our TIDE (Together for Inclusion Diversity and Equity) program, we create a safe and welcoming space for employees to openly and respectfully discuss social issues we face in our communities. <br></p><h6><b>Opportunities for Learning and Growth</b> </h6><p>There is nothing quite like a workplace that values your growth and development. Whether it is through training programs, new projects or helping another team, finding a company that believes in your potential and is ready to invest in it is key. It opens limitless possibilities in your career, making you more adaptable and versatile. As leaders, we can kickstart this process for future leaders. I take pride in being part of a company that invests in its employees at all levels, whether they are just starting or seasoned leaders. We get the chance to learn new skills through training programs led by experts from around the globe, which makes us more capable of tackling fresh challenges. Over 80% of our management roles last year were filled from internal promotions. That is the result of working for a company that cares about its people and their career journey.<br></p><p>So now you know what to look for, but how do you know what a company’s work culture is really like? You can:</p><ul style=""margin-left: 30px""><li>Dive into their website to see if their values, mission and activities resonate with you. Ask yourself, ‘is this a company (or leader) I’d be proud to work for?</li><li>Don’t shy away from asking questions during the interview that help YOU decide if you want the job. We love candidates who are clear about their expectations and eager to learn more about our company.</li><li>Go check out the work environment. Can you imagine working there? Alorica offers walk-in interviews at our sites so that we can make the hiring process very efficient.

        ","<p>Deciding to make the move to automation is one thing. Knowing where to start is another. No doubt you’ve done your homework—read the latest blogs and eBooks like&nbsp;<a href=""/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">5 Ways to Drive Calls Out of Your Call Center</a>— yet you still can’t quite figure out how to get started. &nbsp; </p><p>That’s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service.&nbsp; Remember, automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for building a strategic framework, you’ll be able to distinguish the simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework is as simple as two steps. &nbsp; </p><br><h5><strong>Step 1: Dial in on Demographics</strong></h5><p>Consider the demographic of your caller—and your industry. A <strong>West Interactive Services CX Marks the Spot</strong> study found that customers’ likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service depends on the service provided.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p><p>Take the Government Services/Healthcare sector, for example. While there is a larger appetite for interactive channels including online chat, self-help, etc., fewer customers are open to a mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast, in the Automotive sector, the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater, with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted channels. &nbsp; </p><p>When it comes to age, non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a traditional service channel—phone, email, in-person, chat or self-help–whereas a Millennial is 5 to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media platform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for self-service automation. &nbsp; </p><p>Launch your self-service engagement strategy early on, leveraging your customers’ profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how, when and where to market and engage customers on the available self-service channel options. After all, you want to bring the greatest value–targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer. &nbsp; </p><br><h5><strong>Step 2: Revisit Customer Data</strong></h5><p>Take a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example – are they calling for password resets, package tracking, balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving, then it is more suitable for automation. &nbsp; </p><p>Then, analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense of resolution? &nbsp; </p><p>While originally designed for repeat contact reduction, the same steps work for all contacts. Identify contact reasons, develop solutions, check in to see that the plan is working and act to achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice to take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience. &nbsp; </p><p>Drawing conclusions from the data you already have positions you for a meaningful conversation about where to go with the automation of your business processes. &nbsp; </p><p>Still need help?

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/put-your-heart-in-it,"<h4>THE CLIENT</h4> <p>This client, a leading provider of Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services, sought to continue providing their customers with exceptional support during seasonal times of high customer enrollment. Alorica was called upon to create a flexible, burstable staffing model to ensure that they were always meeting their customer’s needs, as well as providing information on new customer opportunities.</p> <h4>THE PROGRAM</h4> <p>The client was receiving a high amount of calls during their annual enrollment cycles. Unlike traditional mail services, the client’s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding high-end medications, while also providing those customers new services for consideration. Consequently, the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales. &nbsp; </p> <p>As they say in Gotham, when the Commissioner calls, you pick up. And we do. &nbsp; </p> <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4> <p>Alorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client’s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers. &nbsp; </p> <p>That’s right. We doubled our workforce. That’s just the kind of thing we do for our clients. But we digress. &nbsp; </p> <p>We deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensity-to-contact members, ultimately reducing the client’s overall cost per prescription. Furthermore, we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations, and created welcome calls as part of a member’s engagement strategy. To do so, we analyzed landline leads, conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week in which to contact them. Finally, we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative, low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case. &nbsp; </p> <h4>THE RESULTS</h4> <ul> <li>Top performer for increasing prescription conversions, per contact, by 10-15%</li> <br> <li>Consistently a top performer among all of the client’s internal contact centers</li> <br> <li>Since implementing Alorica’s custom program, the client has experienced a 6% increase on member scores and a 19% increase on provider scores</li> </ul> <p>Click above to download the full case study.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp;",h4the clienth4 pthis client a leading provider of pharmacy benefit management pbm services sought to continue providing their customers with exceptional support during seasonal times of high customer enrollment alorica was called upon to create a flexible burstable staffing model to ensure that they were always meeting their customer’s needs as well as providing information on new customer opportunitiesp h4the programh4 pthe client was receiving a high amount of calls during their annual enrollment cycles unlike traditional mail services the client’s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding highend medications while also providing those customers new services for consideration consequently the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales nbsp p pas they say in gotham when the commissioner calls you pick up and we do nbsp p h4the solutionh4 palorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client’s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers nbsp p pthat’s right we doubled our workforce that’s just the kind of thing we do for our clients but we digress nbsp p pwe deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensitytocontact members ultimately reducing the client’s overall cost per prescription furthermore we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations and created welcome calls as part of a member’s engagement strategy to do so we analyzed landline leads conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week in which to contact them finally we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative lowcost channels to contact those members casebycase nbsp p h4the resultsh4 ul litop performer for increasing prescription conversions per contact by 1015li br liconsistently a top performer among all of the client’s internal contact centersli br lisince implementing alorica’s custom program the client has experienced a 6 increase on member scores and a 19 increase on provider scoresli ul pclick above to download the full case studyp nbsp nbsp

            https://alorica.com/insights/resource/burnout-stinks-signs-and-solutions-to-prevent-call-center-burnout
        ","<p>The burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found that employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty picture for the men and women in our organizations. It’s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it’s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017). &nbsp; </p><p>Contact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer service representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than the national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014). &nbsp; </p><h4><strong>What Exactly is Employee Burnout?</strong></h4><p>The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn’t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as “a syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do ‘people work’ of some kind” (Jackson, 1981). &nbsp; </p><p>In the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister, 2016), agents <em>want</em> to deliver excellent service in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers. Agents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service. &nbsp; </p><h4><strong>What Are Those Burnout Symptoms?</strong></h4><p>Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from their work. It’s an uphill battle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson, 1981): &nbsp; </p><ul><li><strong>Increased Emotional Exhaustion:</strong> Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level.</li><li><strong>Cynicism Towards Customers:</strong> Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion.</li><li><strong>Professional Efficacy: </strong>“The tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one’s work with customers.” In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the consequences can be quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><strong>Solutions to Prevent Agent Burnout</strong></h4><p>In my experience, burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy. To prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must: &nbsp; </p><p style=""padding-left: 30px""><strong>1. Avoid Favoritism</strong>: Treat people with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one person or group against another, will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px""><strong>2. Have Clear Values</strong>: Make sure that operational processes and the company’s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees perceive a value conflict on the job, their engagement with work tends to decrease.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px""><strong>3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: </strong>Establish continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact center environment.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px""><strong>4. Understand the Contact Center Environment: </strong>Training or seminars can enhance the employee’s capacity to cope with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead, the organization should start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself.</p><p>Burnout is commonplace, and no one is immune to it. It’s important to structure your work environment so that every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed. At Alorica, we’re focused on creating insanely great customer interactions.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/future-of-trust-and-safety-blog,"<p>The Trust &amp; Safety Professional Organization (TSPA) is a global community of Trust &amp; Safety professionals who develop and enforce principles, policies, and practices to create online standards of behavior and content facilitated by digital technologies. The association is overseen by venerated tech pioneers, legal experts, and professors, including former COOs of Mozilla and Heads of Policy from Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. </p><p>TPSA offers a comprehensive overview into Trust &amp; Safety, both as an industry and as a practice, including <a href=""https://www.tspa.org/curriculum/ts-fundamentals/industry-overview/future-of-ts/"" data-sf-ec-immutable=""""><i>The Future of Trust &amp; Safety</i></a><i>, </i>a review of new challenges presented by the continued evolution of technology and the pervasive nature of threats online. In the market overview, the TSPA defines several key areas of focus; as a leading Trust &amp; Safety provider for ~15 years, our perspective offers a seasoned view on these trends. </p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h5>Increased investments to keep users safe</h5><p>As detailed by the TPSA, companies have been investing more in Trust &amp; Safety, particularly over the past decade. Industries from nearly every niche are prioritizing online safety, from beefing up security to harnessing AI/NLP technology to streamline multi-media moderation efforts. </p><p>For online platforms and eCommerce websites, keeping users safe is a top priority—safeguarding against bad actors, fraud, and malicious content is essential to bottom lines—requiring constant oversight and action in an ever-changing landscape.</p><p>Keeping ahead of the curve is essential for successful content moderation, as well as anticipating client needs. Investing heavily in leading-edge technology and top-tier talent, partnering with third-party technology developers, and working with diverse, global Trust &amp; Safety teams gives companies an advantage against online threats. </p><p>And we couldn’t agree more; our many investments include implementing proprietary and third-party tools to streamline multilingual, multi-media content moderation, speed up collaboration and information flow, and enhance training, coaching, and retention. &nbsp;</p><p>But, in our experience, we’ve found that it’s just as important to take care of your frontline content moderators, those intrepid individuals staring down online threats day after day. Caring for our people is a bedrock principle at Alorica; digital, gamified apps and to assess engagement and mood, ongoing wellness coaching and training, as well as anytime access to licensed mental health professionals, keep our content moderators going strong. </p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h5>Proactive and protective efforts</h5><p>As bad actors and cybercriminals become increasingly sophisticated, cybersecurity strategies continually evolve to meet new threats. A highlight of the TPSA report is the importance of keeping customers and clients safe online; this requires a deep understanding of the different ways users can be harmed, as well as how they act with online platforms.&nbsp; </p><p>Successful Trust &amp; Safety efforts adapt to policy changes, keeping both clients and content moderators up-to-date about what threats are out there—and what can be done about them. We’ve found deep analytics to be absolutely invaluable for illuminating user behavior, as well as isolating known threats.</p><p>To best support the needs and requirements of leading global brands, Alorica’s approach relies on a combination of data-driven analytics, a nimble and scalable worldwide workforce, proprietary technology, and training models to ensure content moderation is always accurate, expedient, and based on intent, local context, current events, and community guidelines. </p><h5><b>&nbsp;</b></h5><h5>Keeping in lockstep with new legislation and regulations</h5><p>What’s online has been influencing everything from public policy to fashion trends for over a quarter century, and how people communicate in online spaces has become increasingly important to everyone from governments, corporations, and organizations to individuals. </p><p>As the TPSA advises, free expression is vital to online communities, but companies and countries often have to grapple with what’s said and spread online without existing guidelines, creating new policies quickly because users expect the platforms they use to be safe and secure at all times. </p><p>In practice, we’ve found that it’s essential to keep up with corporate policies and regulatory changes, and continually educate all Trust &amp; Safety specialists, including content moderators, as well as proactively prepare for changing requirements. </p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h6>Ready to learn more?</h6><p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/products/content-moderation"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.alorica.com/outcomes/community/content-management/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""" data-sf-marked="""">Content Moderation</a>&nbsp;solutions page to see how Alorica can help you create Trust &amp;

The client discovered this first-hand, as their existing team couldn’t run concurrent chats and made missteps—and simply didn’t have the bandwidth to support everything at once. Shortly after launching our program, we successfully migrated the first wave of voice-support agents over to chat and email—and buoyed by their success, prepared to expand. </p> <p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong><strong><br> Multitasking to the Rescue!</strong> </p> <p>Our agents in this program are in a totally different kind of position; they not only need to be proficient in tech support but have to be able to toggle between multiple conversations at once. Our proprietary hiring analytics platform played a key role in sourcing the right talent; this technology allowed us to construct the ideal agent profile, and we used the platform to screen candidates for their multitasking abilities, ultimately hiring agents best suited for the complex, multi-channel work. The new, Jamaica-based team quickly exceeded expectations in both customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall Quality Assurance (QA). Coupled with cutting down Average Handle Time (AHT) and the cost savings this nearshore location offered, the client was thrilled </p> <p><strong>THE OUTCOME</strong><strong><br> Ever-expanding Opportunities.</strong> </p> <p>Thanks to the success of the program, we continue to absorb more volume from the client, and we are currently exploring ways to expand lines of business. We began with just a few agents in this multi-channel support role, and we’re on pace to more than quadruple the number of agents by the end of 2019.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/go-big-and-go-home-work-at-home-case-study,"<h5>UNPRECEDENTED TIMEFRAMES. UNREAL CIRCUMSTANCES. UNMATCHED RESULTS.</h5> <p>Alorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck, and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model, this wasn’t our first WAH rodeo. Far from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable, as we worked to migrate the client’s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment—in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative—and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we’ll get to all that. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>THE RESULTS</h5> &nbsp; <ul> <li>Attrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) agents in the same program</li> <li>Customers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&amp;M employees</li> <li>AHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&amp;M</li> <li>Contact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h5>THE CHALLENGE</h5> &nbsp; <p><strong>Experience when it mattered most.</strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>Prior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program—including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that agents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding, training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing model, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still, moving that many agents in such a short timeframe—and against the backdrop of COVID-19—was no small order </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5> &nbsp; <p><strong>Best practices for a best-in-class result. </strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>Time was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently. &nbsp; </p> <p>Existing best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents, and as they adjusted to their new at-home environment, we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both agents and leadership. These routines were grounded in a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards, two-way virtual agent communication, collaboration and top-notch leadership support—and were a vital component of previous and ongoing success. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>THE OUTCOME</h5> &nbsp; <p><strong>Leveraging the past and looking to the future. </strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>Several months into the new normal, the client’s work-at-home teams consistently outperform their legacy B&amp;M counterparts in key metrics. Today, as regulations slowly allow employees to return on-site, a hub-and-spoke model is being used; agents are acquiring skills in a B&amp;M environment, before ‘graduating’ to WAH when and if circumstances dictate In fact, our success with the program has earned us a best-in-class reputation—against which now benchmark agent performance. &nbsp; </p> <p>It’s an unpredictable world out there—and preparedness and confidence in a solution goes a long way. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>ABOUT ALORICA</h5> <p>Alorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

        ","<p>A streamlined troubleshooting guide can help effectively resolve a customer issue and improve the overall customer experience. Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service environment or through an interactive voice response system (IVR). It’s a critical component of self-service, designed to empower the customer through the resolution process. &nbsp; </p> <p>In a time of information overload, it’s important to keep information accessible, current and accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to Salesforce, 75% of consumers say that say it is important to be able to interact with a company on <em>their </em>personal schedule.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Follow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution and increases overall satisfaction. After all, the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making it easy for them to do business with you. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Identify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve</strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>As you build your customer knowledgebase, the first step is identifying possible scenarios or problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting. &nbsp; </p> <p>Some examples include: </p> <ul> <li>Setting up an account</li> <br> <li>Resetting a password</li> <br> <li>Accessing an account</li> <br> <li>Reinstating service</li> <br> <li>Adding services to the account</li> </ul> <p>This is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs).&nbsp; HAPs help you to identify where the customer is when the need for help arises.&nbsp; Your strategy for how to design and deliver customer facing service content would be impacted by the HAPs identified.&nbsp; A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed. &nbsp; </p> <p>A recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are recommending that specific brand.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>As you think through potential reasons a customer would need support, keep in mind the customer lifecycle of your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Create the Self-Service Content</strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>Now that you’ve compiled the list of potential customer issues, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential customer issues. &nbsp; </p> <p>The first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree and a process map. </p> <ul> <li>A decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on what occurs at each step.</li> <br> <li>A process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an issue.</li> </ul> <p>When you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps, it’s important that you think about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For example, when you are guiding a customer through self-help, it’s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the steps for resolution. &nbsp; </p> <p>It is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly.&nbsp; Resolving a customer’s issue through self-service doesn’t need to be complex.&nbsp; In a recent article, Gartner states that organizations often have very complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and knowledge are key attributes of leading enterprises. <sup>&nbsp;3</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Developing content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for both self-service and contact center support, the less content management you will need post-deployment. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Understand How Often Your Content is Being Used</strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>In any business, measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase.&nbsp; To measure the effectiveness of your content, you need to understand how often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer’s issue. </p> <ul> <li>In a self-service environment, you can include a question—<em>Did this information resolve your issue?</em> —after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps.</li> <br> <li>In a contact center environment, the agent can ask the question, or you can collect the data through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer’s issue, it’s also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for searches. This insight will help you optimize your search functionality and your content management strategy. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Maintain Your Self-Service Content</strong> &nbsp; </p> <p>A knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately, it increases the effort required by your customers as they search through large quantities of content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt an unnecessary increase in call volumes. &nbsp; </p> <p>Even further, too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand.&nbsp; Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand because of the ability to easily find the information or help they need.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>You must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center, but content management will ultimately drive your success. &nbsp; </p> <p>To be successful at content management, define a process to update your knowledgebase. </p> <ul> <li>Establish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated.</li> <br> <li>Maintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates.</li> <br> <li>Update the key search words based on current content available.</li> <br> <li>Remove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites replace the original articles.</li> </ul> <p>The support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their own issues in a way that’s fast and easy. A study by Ganter predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever needing to interact with another person.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>In this DIY era, offering self-service is a necessity. It shows you are listening and understand the way your customers want to be served. Meanwhile, it deflects unnecessary call volumes thereby reducing your overall cost per transaction. Using an effective knowledgebase content plan to deliver an effortless self-service experience compliments customer support and provides the customer multiple ways to resolve their issue. When done effectively, this drives improvement in the overall customer experience and improves how customers feel about your brand. &nbsp; </p> <p>SOURCES: </p> <ol> <li><a

She wanted to work with people because building relationships was her passion. So, it’s no surprise that a job in recruiting was her next step. &nbsp; </p><p>With a background in temporary staffing, employment management in the hotel industry, and corporate recruiting, her role at Alorica has allowed her to meld her two strengths together: managing teams and matching individuals with the right job opportunities. She has found success by truly believing in what she’s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle courses that you can overcome. Read Karly’s full Q&amp;A below: &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What gets you up in the morning?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> Knowing that I have a direct impact on really pleasing our customers and our clients and growing Alorica. Every day we have hundreds of agents starting in our organization. I love doing what I do because I know I am making a difference, and I add the human touch into it. When I am visiting sites and I see the family feel and see people connecting to others, I love knowing that people are making long-lasting relationships at work. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What are the key ways that you approach challenges in your day to day work?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A: </font> I’m a visual type of person. What I tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice is, “okay, list the obstacles, and now let’s talk about how we will go about removing those obstacles.” Then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle. After you’ve gotten through your obstacle course, it’s helpful to go back and, in your mind, list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and fixed them. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: How do you view mentorship in the workplace?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A: </font> I advanced in my career because mentors set great examples. In my first job out of college, I absorbed everything like a sponge. Whether they knew it or not, there were people who I looked at for inspiration. Their actions helped me learn and grow. Today, I find mentors everywhere--they are the people that leave me thinking after a phone call. They get my mind turning, help me understand challenges, and get me thinking about how I can take control of what I can control. &nbsp;</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What motivated you in pursuing this career path?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> I wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people. In recruiting, you’re always giving good news. “You got a job! Congratulations!” If I can go to bed at night thinking to myself, “Today, I placed 30 people in positions, I know they’re excited and I’m excited.” That was my drive for choosing my own job roles throughout my career. &nbsp;</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: Did you have a specific career plan that led to your current role at Alorica?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> For me, it hasn’t necessarily been about making a long-term career plan. An opportunity came up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a Sr. Director of Talent Acquisition. It helped get me back into managing people, an area in which I am also passionate about. Having been with Alorica for almost six years, I love making an impact on the organization in both areas.</p>",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2tmb0pngsfvrsna6392a302img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2 imgappnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppwhen bkarly jandocb alorica’s sr director talent acquisition was in college she knew one thing for sure about her career goals she wanted to work with people because building relationships was her passion so it’s no surprise that a job in recruiting was her next step nbsp ppwith a background in temporary staffing employment management in the hotel industry and corporate recruiting her role at alorica has allowed her to meld her two strengths together managing teams and matching individuals with the right job opportunities she has found success by truly believing in what she’s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle courses that you can overcome read karly’s full qampa below nbsp ppfont color98521cq what gets you up in the morningfontfont color98521cbrafont knowing that i have a direct impact on really pleasing our customers and our clients and growing alorica every day we have hundreds of agents starting in our organization i love doing what i do because i know i am making a difference and i add the human touch into it when i am visiting sites and i see the family feel and see people connecting to others i love knowing that people are making longlasting relationships at work nbsp ppfont color98521cq what are the key ways that you approach challenges in your day to day workfontfont color98521cbra font i’m a visual type of person what i tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice is “okay list the obstacles and now let’s talk about how we will go about removing those obstacles” then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle after you’ve gotten through your obstacle course it’s helpful to go back and in your mind list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and fixed them nbsp ppfont color98521cq how do you view mentorship in the workplacefontfont color98521cbra font i advanced in my career because mentors set great examples in my first job out of college i absorbed everything like a sponge whether they knew it or not there were people who i looked at for inspiration their actions helped me learn and grow today i find mentors everywherethey are the people that leave me thinking after a phone call they get my mind turning help me understand challenges and get me thinking about how i can take control of what i can control nbspppfont color98521cq what motivated you in pursuing this career pathfontfont color98521cbrafont i wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people in recruiting you’re always giving good news “you got a job congratulations” if i can go to bed at night thinking to myself “today i placed 30 people in positions i know they’re excited and i’m excited” that was my drive for choosing my own job roles throughout my career nbspppfont color98521cq did you have a specific career plan that led to your current role at aloricafontfont color98521cbrafont for me it hasn’t necessarily been about making a longterm career plan an opportunity came up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a sr director of talent acquisition it helped get me back into managing people an area in which i am also passionate about having been with alorica for almost six years i love making an impact on the organization in both areasp

Illustrating this point beautifully is this month’s Alorican in Action, VP of Client Solutions, <b>Beverley Bridges</b>. </p><p>Read Beverley’s Q&amp;A below to explore her unique 13-year career at Alorica (and counting), and advice for succeeding on your own path. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: Did you have a plan to reach an executive-level position?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> I’d like to say that I strategically orchestrated my career every step of the way, but that would be a lie. Being successful has meant always doing my best, recognizing that I am responsible for the choices that I make, and treating people how I want them to treat me. I believe that diversity is what makes us great, so I like to bring my perspective to situations and encourage others to do so as well. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: Did you ever work with a mentor, and did that process help you?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> I have a lot of mentors—and most of them don’t even know I see them that way! My philosophy is that the <i>life you live speaks louder than the words you say</i>. Mentors have been both colleagues and people I know outside of work—almost everyone has taught me something.</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What advice would you give about climbing the career ladder?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> Know your value. If you don’t know it, nobody else will. Also, lift others as you climb and don’t give up or give in if your career track isn’t going as you imagined—resiliency is a great skill to master. Lastly, don’t burn bridges. You never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague for advice or a fresh point of view. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?</font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> My grandmother and mother always said, “get in where you fit in.” Through my regular one-on-one meetings with each of my clients, I try to find commonalities; it doesn’t have to be about work, but perhaps family, hobbies, upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us. Connecting with people is how you build trust and respect. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Q: What excites you most about what you do? </font><font color=""#98521c""><br>A:</font> Taking on new challenges. The hurdles are exciting, and once you get to the other side of it, you can say, “this is what we did.” What also brings me joy is keeping people motivated. I think it’s very important as women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward. Surround yourself with people who share your goals and objectives, and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track. You may not always like what they have to say, but as women, authentic relationships are critical.</p>",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2 imgappnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbsppphave you ever asked a leader “any advice for someone who aspires to be in your position” chances are you’ve probably gotten different replies each time—which just goes to show there’s no one way to the top illustrating this point beautifully is this month’s alorican in action vp of client solutions bbeverley bridgesb ppread beverley’s qampa below to explore her unique 13year career at alorica and counting and advice for succeeding on your own path ppfont color98521cq did you have a plan to reach an executivelevel positionfontfont color98521cbrafont i’d like to say that i strategically orchestrated my career every step of the way but that would be a lie being successful has meant always doing my best recognizing that i am responsible for the choices that i make and treating people how i want them to treat me i believe that diversity is what makes us great so i like to bring my perspective to situations and encourage others to do so as well ppfont color98521cq did you ever work with a mentor and did that process help youfontfont color98521cbrafont i have a lot of mentors—and most of them don’t even know i see them that way my philosophy is that the ilife you live speaks louder than the words you sayi mentors have been both colleagues and people i know outside of work—almost everyone has taught me somethingppfont color98521cq what advice would you give about climbing the career ladderfontfont color98521cbrafont know your value if you don’t know it nobody else will also lift others as you climb and don’t give up or give in if your career track isn’t going as you imagined—resiliency is a great skill to master lastly don’t burn bridges you never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague for advice or a fresh point of view ppfont color98521cq what is your advice on how to make meaningful connectionsfontfont color98521cbrafont my grandmother and mother always said “get in where you fit in” through my regular oneonone meetings with each of my clients i try to find commonalities it doesn’t have to be about work but perhaps family hobbies upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us connecting with people is how you build trust and respect ppfont color98521cq what excites you most about what you do fontfont color98521cbrafont taking on new challenges the hurdles are exciting and once you get to the other side of it you can say “this is what we did” what also brings me joy is keeping people motivated i think it’s very important as women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward surround yourself with people who share your goals and objectives and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track you may not always like what they have to say but as women authentic relationships are criticalp

        ","<p>I am so incredibly proud of the culture we’ve built—and continue to grow—at Alorica. From office celebrations to company-wide contests and recognition, taking care of our people is our #1 priority—and we work tirelessly to keep our teams engaged, inspired and connected. &nbsp; </p> <p>It all starts with our four Core Values: <strong>Be Connected, Be Bold, Be Relentless </strong>and <strong>Be True</strong>. These tenets empower every Alorica employee, and describe how we do what<em> </em>we do. As a company, everything we prioritize and stand for—including the way we recognize each other’s accomplishments, train new staff and measure success—closely aligns with each Value. &nbsp; </p> <p>And by adhering to our Values, we can more effectively deliver on our Brand Promise: <strong>Passion. Performance. Possibilities</strong>.&nbsp;This is the pledge we make each and every day to our clients and their customers—and it’s what fuels our vision of making lives better…one interaction at a time. &nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="""" src=""/images/default-source/insights/alorica_csr.png?sfvrsn=6658460e_0"" height=""250"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-56818"" width=""250"">&nbsp; </p> <p>Our world-class culture is grounded in charitable giving, engaging social impact and environmental sustainability initiatives. Aloricans want more than a job—they want a purpose—and as Chief Culture Officer, I’m honored to partner with leaders across the organization and provide opportunities to such an amazing and conscientious workforce. Every culture/employee experience program we’ve developed allows our people to explore and grow, and enables them to connect with not only the company, but each other. Some of these programs include: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Culture Champions &amp; Committees</strong></h5> <p>Every Alorica site has its own Culture Committee—led by a Culture Champion—whose members plan on-site events and help oversee company-wide celebrations and contests. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Making Lives Better With Alorica(MLBA)</strong></h5> <p>Our approach to corporate philanthropy is like none other. With 80 MLBA chapters around the world, employees have the decision-making power to choose how to make lives better through grants, fundraisers and volunteering. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR)</strong></h5> <p>Doing the right thing, and taking care of one another, is an integral part of who we are. Alorica was built on three P’s—Passion, Performance and Possibilities. But when it comes to CSR, we focus on another three: Philanthropy, People and Planet. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Game Changer </strong></h5> <p>We make it a point to recognize when our people go above and beyond. Our Game Changer<em> </em>program is held company-wide, and celebrates and rewards top performers. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Women’s Initiative</strong></h5> <p>Our Women’s Initiative champions amazing female Aloricans around the globe. This program provides a platform in which our Alorica community comes together to connect, support and develop our current and future leaders. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Aloricans In Action</strong></h5> <p>Aloricans in Action gives us the opportunity to highlight outstanding members of our team, and celebrate the efforts of a global workforce that performs with passion and embraces all kinds of possibilities. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Alorica Academy </strong></h5> <p>The Alorica Academy is a comprehensive global leadership development platform that allows our people to learn, contribute, share and grow professionally. It offers clear visibility into career development opportunities, and helps leadership identify who is ready for the next level—ensuring we maintain a strong, sustainable bench of talent. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>Aloricares</strong></h5> <p>It’s a privilege to give back to those who have given so much.

Armed with a master’s degree in philosophy, this Director of Client Solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the root causes of an issue and to help guide her to a solution.</p><p>Pency started out as an agent and has since held positions in quality, training and operations management. She believes change can be scary, but it’s also good. Read her full Q&amp;A below. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What professional advice has helped you in your career?</font> <br>Early on, I was trying to fit into the mold of what I thought a young, strong black woman in corporate America was supposed to be like. I have a really big personality, I’m very opinionated and I can come off a little harsh sometimes, but I was silencing myself. Then Colleen Beers gave me the best advice: she said to “be Pency.” That really freed me up to come into my own. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Looking back, do you regret any career moves you did or didn’t make?</font> <br>Once Andy Lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve, but I didn’t speak up because I didn’t want to come off as a know-it-all or be a troublemaker. I wasn’t being Pency! I really regret not using my voice when I had the opportunity, but I don’t hold back anymore. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">How can we all continue to better ourselves at work?</font> <br>Our success is dependent upon each other, so see what you can do to improve. Take every class and attend every conference that’s offered to you. Last year I attended COPC certification training, and it was my most eye-opening experience ever, both personally and professionally. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What does it take to build lasting relationships with colleagues, clients and other contacts?</font> <br>A lot of people have difficulty delivering bad news, especially to clients, but my main thing is honest communication. I won’t sugarcoat it, I’ll just say it. And if it can be fixed, they know that I’ll roll up my sleeves and dig in.</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?</font> <br>Be honest. Let your personality come through, and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. A meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone, and they’re who they are to you. It’s the only way.</p>",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2 imgappnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppsixfoottall pency smith says she can sometimes seem intimidating especially when she’s thinking armed with a master’s degree in philosophy this director of client solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the root causes of an issue and to help guide her to a solutionpppency started out as an agent and has since held positions in quality training and operations management she believes change can be scary but it’s also good read her full qampa below ppfont color98521cwhat professional advice has helped you in your careerfont brearly on i was trying to fit into the mold of what i thought a young strong black woman in corporate america was supposed to be like i have a really big personality i’m very opinionated and i can come off a little harsh sometimes but i was silencing myself then colleen beers gave me the best advice she said to “be pency” that really freed me up to come into my own ppfont color98521clooking back do you regret any career moves you did or didn’t makefont bronce andy lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve but i didn’t speak up because i didn’t want to come off as a knowitall or be a troublemaker i wasn’t being pency i really regret not using my voice when i had the opportunity but i don’t hold back anymore ppfont color98521chow can we all continue to better ourselves at workfont brour success is dependent upon each other so see what you can do to improve take every class and attend every conference that’s offered to you last year i attended copc certification training and it was my most eyeopening experience ever both personally and professionally ppfont color98521cwhat does it take to build lasting relationships with colleagues clients and other contactsfont bra lot of people have difficulty delivering bad news especially to clients but my main thing is honest communication i won’t sugarcoat it i’ll just say it and if it can be fixed they know that i’ll roll up my sleeves and dig inppfont color98521cwhat is your advice on how to make meaningful connectionsfont brbe honest let your personality come through and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable a meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone and they’re who they are to you it’s the only wayp

        ","<p>What’s on the horizon for marketers this year? To find out, I sought insight from the following nine tech executives . &nbsp; </p><p><strong>We will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing.</strong> Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint &nbsp; </p><p>“Standard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches to handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in that funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.” &nbsp; </p><p>In terms of digital fluency, marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we’d be going into 2021. Alicia Tillman, Global Chief Marketing Officer at SAP &nbsp; </p><p>“The technology, the tactics, the flexible mindset – with these tools, disruption is no longer the showstopper it once was. As the world moves forward day by day, marketers are more prepared than ever to be agile and deliver the experiences audiences need, when they need them. Rather than months-long marketing campaigns, brand marketing will more closely mirror the way we’re living our lives as individuals. In the moment, deeply empathetic, and tuned into each other’s needs.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>We will see a stark divide in an organization’s marketing budget spend, followed by consequential impact.</strong> Jim Kruger, Chief Marketing Officer, Veeam &nbsp; </p><p>“With the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year, there will be a resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end, companies will look to cut back on marketing budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be managed up or down fairly easily. On the other end, companies will increase investment in marketing because they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead, those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will ultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on, and by toggling budgets up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue to invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Verifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. </strong>Dan Lowden, Chief Marketing Officer, White Ops <br>“In 2021, marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing spend. Marketers will partner with specialists that can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans – resulting in better customer experience, ensuring higher engagement, bringing visibility to cleaner data, improving the company's compliance position and driving stronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is effectively spent.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Recent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise their walls even higher.</strong>Abhay Singhal, CEO, InMobi Marketing Cloud &nbsp; </p><p>“This is an extremely uncertain period of time, and CMOs shouldn’t have one roadmap – they should have multiple. For starters, marketing teams will need to be prepared to make the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing within the app. On the flip side, marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as possible. Without this, advertisers are at risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over, which compromises brand image and user experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical, and marketers need to start setting expectations and redefining metrics as soon as possible.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Company culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing talent.</strong> Amanda Bohne, Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta &nbsp; </p><p>“Now that so many companies have proven that, for many, remote work can be as effective as in-office work, it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will now be sought after by companies located across the country, enabling them to potentially live somewhere different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company where in-office work is mandated will start to meaningfully impact your candidate pool, and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>No matter what product you sell, what you need to market is trust. </strong>Dale Renner CEO, Co-Founder, RedPoint Global &nbsp; </p><p>“Consumers want trust in the product quality, trust in the organization handling your data, trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs, trust that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately driven through a series of interactions – those brands that are responsible with a consumer’s data and use it to create value for the consumer, those that provide consistent experiences, those that operate at the consumer’s cadence will build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy, will experience a dramatic decline in customer loyalty and brand value. ” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>B2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with existing customers.</strong> Elena Filimonova, SVP, Marketing CGS &nbsp; </p><p>“Marketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits of their service, while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers, Marketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the current environment.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Google and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and data privacy.</strong> Susan Lee, Chief Product Officer, Valassis &nbsp; </p><p>“In the new year, it’s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on a one-to-one or known basis. Instead, marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base, maximizing scale.” &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Omnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty.</strong> Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer, <a href=""https://alorica.com/"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Alorica Inc.</a> &nbsp; </p><p>“In today’s 'continuously-connected' way of life, it’s not enough that brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX—being able to alternate quickly from different platforms, but for these channels to also be personalized, persistent and effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021, you’ll see more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers’ wants through advanced analytics and embedded intelligence, which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that allow brands to market, sell and serve their customers better and faster. When brands proactively ‘push’ tailored experiences rather than rely on customers to ‘pull’ from services after they’ve had a problem, that changes the nature of the relationship, offering insights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of always-connected consumers, new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights, context and channels that ultimately redefine brand loyalty.” &nbsp;

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/designing-a-survey-strategy-6-tips-for-success,"<p>A common topic of conversation in the customer experience world is the ideal customer satisfaction survey. How many questions should it include? What are the right channels? How do you increase survey return rates? &nbsp; </p> <p>While these questions make sense, are they the right questions to ask? Rather than trying to find the perfect survey (minimal questions with insightful answers, and a high rate of return), companies should consider asking a different question—is the current method for delivering surveys generating the data needed to improve the business, as well as the overall customer experience? &nbsp; </p> <p>A better use of time and resources is to reevaluate the strategy used to gather sentiment. Use these 6 tips as a starting point to help ensure that you continually receive useful data from the consumers that best represent your customer base. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>1. Ask the right people.</strong></h5> <p>The people answering your surveys are likely not the best representatives of your customer base. According to Gartner, the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and very upset. This creates a data set that omits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the majority of the company’s customers.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>To gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses crave, it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate, which leads to our next point. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>2. Keep customers from saying, ‘No way, survey!’</strong></h5> <p>Surveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your user quitting the survey part way through, and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Businesses who are focusing on how to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to communicate, and tailor the channels utilized accordingly. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>3. Ask the right questions.</strong></h5> <p>Several companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction questions. These general questions don’t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to improve a business. &nbsp; </p> <p>Survey Monkey suggests that companies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization—and making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights—is what will help you reach your goals.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Think about what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent performance, customer loyalty to your brand, or both? Answer these questions, and you will know the questions to ask. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>4. Keep the survey relevant.</strong></h5> <p>Gainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how the request arrives. <sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p> <p>Traditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl,<a href=""https://www.shopify.com/retail/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-beacon-technology-for-retail-stores"">*</a>&nbsp;over 70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a purchase during a store visit.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Don’t be afraid to be bold when considering options! &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>5. Show the value.</strong></h5> <p>Customers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback on a product or experience. Don’t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole. Show customers a direct correlation between feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by trumpeting improvements made to products/services based on direct customer feedback. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>6. Use the data available to you.</strong></h5> <p>Most businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and voice analytics solutions can be used to analyze interaction transcripts, providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view several different aspects of their business—products, support service options and agent interactions to name a few. &nbsp; </p> <p>This list doesn’t cover everything to consider for your customer feedback gathering strategy, but it is a starting point.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/finding-ohmni-channel-nirvana-3-ways-to-get-there,"<p>Customers making contact expect a company to wrap together all forms of communication from traditional to social. In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether they’re shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>In the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;By the time they connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise, they wouldn’t be calling to begin with. &nbsp; </p> <p>Consider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be recognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn’t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It’s crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn’t add significant length to the interaction. &nbsp; </p> <p>Many companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes, integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn’t allow for the continuous experience of true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration, what’s left is a solution that causes more harm than good, leaving the burden on the contact center agent to resolve a complicated case. &nbsp; </p> <p>As you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you’re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>1. System consolidation:&nbsp;</strong></h5> <p>How many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history? &nbsp; </p> <p>If the answer is more than one, it’s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember, the more history the front line is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>2. Multichannel platform integration:</strong></h5> <p>Does your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage? &nbsp; </p> <p>If the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social media, and AI, the details of these touches must push to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience. &nbsp; </p> <h5><strong>3. Employee experience considerations:</strong></h5> <p>Now that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents? </p> <ul> <li>As employee expectations become more complex, training investments will be critical to ongoing success. Consider what concepts, such as routine system changes, can be easily adopted through online content delivery. While even the best Learning Management System will not replace the need for facilitator-led content, moving simple content to employee self-service can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and procedural changes to be delivered live in a classroom environment.</li> <li>As you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities, make sure your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will require additional expertise and research time, especially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity, you will invest in agents’ knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened expectations and to prevent employee pool burnout. This will also ensure you are attracting the right level of talent for the job. With self-service channels resulting in reduced contact volume, the funding to provide necessary compensation adjustments should be readily available.</li> </ul> <p>With awareness and attention to these crucial details for a seamless integration, you can confidently forge onward in your quest for automation. Developing a framework to address these three critical areas will help you avoid common pitfalls, leading to true omnichannel leadership. &nbsp; Interested in learning more?

shopping experience whether they’re shopping online from a desktop or mobile device by telephone or in a brickandmortar storesup1sup nbsp p pin the contact center industry omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next before reaching out to customer service 66 of consumers explore prices online before heading to the storesup2supnbspby the time they connect with a contact center customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken they also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community otherwise they wouldn’t be calling to begin with nbsp p pconsider your smartphone it remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you pushing relevant content based on your history customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands they want to be recognized not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could or worse doesn’t possess the baseline capabilities the app does it’s crucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn’t add significant length to the interaction nbsp p pmany companies are making heavy investments in customerfacing digital technology but oftentimes integration with the contact center software is overlooked resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn’t allow for the continuous experience of true omnichannel excellence in many cases multiple systems are still required to achieve one result without proper redesign and integration what’s left is a solution that causes more harm than good leaving the burden on the contact center agent to resolve a

        ","<p><b><u>Why the Philippines?</u></b><br>Some have called the Philippines “the call center capital of the world.” The Republic of the Philippines offers an optimal combination of economic, cultural and educational benefits; making it an excellent location for centers of excellence and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies. Listed here are just a few of the advantages the Philippines offers to multinational enterprises: </p><ul><li>Access to Global Talent</li><br><li>Communication Skills</li><br><li>Infrastructure</li><br><li>Innovative Technology</li></ul><br><p><b><u>What Company Delivers Promises to Deliver “Insanely Great” Customer Experiences? Who Glows?</u></b><br>Frost &amp; Sullivan believes that Alorica Philippines has inserted creativity and innovation into the hard stuff: BPO recruiting, hiring, training and agent retention. &nbsp; </p><p><b><u>Why Alorica?</u></b></p><p><b><u></u></b><b><u></u></b><b><u></u></b>Innovations in Agent Hiring</p><p>Alorica utilizes a robust, high-capacity recruiting and hiring engine using automation. The automation drives speed, agility and volume. It serves as a ‘first round’ interview and candidate engagement tool; handling audio and video responses that capture fluency and articulation. This automated chatbot service is embedded into the Alorica Philippines Facebook Fan page and can be launched from there. &nbsp; </p><h6>What Sets Alorica Apart from other BPOs in the Philippines?</h6><p><b>Microlearning.</b> <br>Aimed at the new wave of Millennials, this just-in-time (JIT) training approach delivers training content when an agent needs it. This new training tool set offers bite-sized modules that are focused on specific learning outcomes. &nbsp; <b>Gamification.</b> <br>Given that 42% of frontline agents fall between the ages of 20 and 36, Alorica’s gamification program appeals to the Millennial population.&nbsp; Alorica in the Philippines utilizes gamification software to aid training and learning; applying game mechanics to non-game experiences to motivate high-value activity and loyalty while reinforcing a fun and positive culture. &nbsp; </p><p><b><u>A Laser Focus on People&nbsp; </u></b><br>Strategic Onboarding</p><p>Note this competitive differentiator: Alorica has developed and evolved a Strategic Onboarding framework and invested in a dedicated Onboarding Team to support the new hire experience, engaging and enabling employees in the first 90 days of employment with the company. The outcome is a highly motivated workforce and significantly improved agent retention. &nbsp; </p><p><b><u>Agent Retention and Company Culture</u></b><br>Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA)</p><p>Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity organization in the U.S. and a non-profit organization in Philippines, Mexico, Canada and Panama which are not subsidiaries or owned by Alorica. Some highlights: </p><ul><li>MLBA Chapters raise monies via fundraisers and payroll contributions. The local Chapter Board determines how funds are granted</li><br><li>100% of all Chapter contributions stays with that Chapter</li><br><li>Alorica and outside donors donate all resources – Chapter seed money, contest money, legal, audit and bank fees, volunteers, IT and admin support, office supplies, call expenses, etc.</li></ul>&nbsp; <p><b><u>Analyst Perspective: Key Takeaways</u></b><br>The Secret Sauce to “Insanely Great”</p><p>Listed below are just a few of the ingredients that are baked into the Alorica Philippines’ DNA, making it an <u>excellent</u> choice for customer care, financial solutions, tech support, revenue generation and Omnichannel solutions: </p><ul><li>State-of-the-art facilities in new-wave, modern cities</li><br><li>Upscale amenities, employee lounges, fitness centers, 24-hour clinics, sleeping quarters, access to public transportation and safe, secure campuses</li><br><li>More than two million square feet of space</li><br><li>Competitive salaries and benefits</li><br><li>Robust career development programs</li><br><li>Strategic, innovative recruiting and onboarding solutions</li></ul><p>The Alorica Philippines team is highly educated—90% of company employees have earned a college degree and have excellent English skills.

And&nbsp;when an auto parts recall or otherwise urgent matter arises,&nbsp;we’re equipped to scale up resources to handle the influx&nbsp;of incoming calls. Whether a ride-sharing teen needs app&nbsp;support or a business executive’s luxury sedan requires routine&nbsp;maintenance, Alorica strives to provide best-in-class service to&nbsp;customers across multiple geographies through voice, email,&nbsp;chat and social media. &nbsp; </p><p>Let’s ride on, shall we? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>ALORICA IN ACTION: ON-DEMAND TRANSPORTATION PROVIDER</h4>&nbsp; <h5>Scalability and Speed to Proficiency</h5><p>A fast-growing, on-demand transportation provider required flexible, rapid ramp-ups and turned to Alorica for help.

        ","&nbsp; <h5 style=""text-align: center""><b>Personalized Digital Solutions + Seamless Customer Experiences = Higher CSAT, FCR and NPS</b><br></h5><p style=""text-align: center""><i>How to convert transactional interactions to long-term customer satisfaction in BFSI&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p style=""text-align: center""><i></i> </p><h4 style=""text-align: center""></h4><p style=""text-align: left"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left"">Here at Alorica—a global Customer Experience (CX) provider—I lead the efforts in engaging some of the most reputable financial institutions in the world to offer our customer support services as an extension of their business. One great question I get asked often from financial services executives is—<i>how should they integrate ‘digital’ in a meaningful way to earn customers’ satisfaction, trust and long-term business?</i> The reality is consumers expect personalized service from the companies they do business with. And while for some industries, like retail, that’s innately part of every brand’s identity; for others, like the banking, financial services, and insurance sector (BFSI), giving customers the digital experiences they want isn’t so simple. Here are some of BFSI’s challenges and the best ways to solve for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left""><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h5><b>Make It Personal&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</h5><p>Consumers, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels, elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial institutions know them—especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information. For many large institutions, the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause additional frustration. As a personal example, when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card, the customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not integrated. This made me feel undervalued as their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX solutions, built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML, along with system integration, can help create tailored product recommendations, savings plans, and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. <a href=""https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/what-does-personalization-banking-really-mean"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">As Boston Consulting Group shared</a>: “Ultimately, if done well, personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking, it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for banks.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><b>Give Them Options</b>&nbsp;</h5><p><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-banking-study-reveals-growth-benefits-of-personalization-innovation-and-trust-in-customer-experience-301674711.html"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude</a>, financial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver more rapid responses, the need to keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use multiple channels to complete transactions, it can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging situation. The customer will want to be heard, discuss their options, and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank employee will guide them through the process. That’s why balance and optionality are key.&nbsp;</p><p>Self-service options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel solutions, enhanced self-service options, improved functionality across digital channels, and 24/7 live support can help reduce the friction, streamline disparate outcomes, and make digital options easier for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h5><b>Partnerships You Can Bank On&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</h5><p>As pointed out in <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/getting-personal-how-banks-can-win-with-consumers"" target=""_blank"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">McKinsey &amp; Company’s 2022 article</a>: “for many [banks], a key struggle is that customer information is housed in different ways across the business and stove piped within functions, preventing the bank from gaining a complete view of the customer,” but by partnering with a CX expert who knows how to deliver the right blend of people, processes, and technology, customers can get the personal experiences they want from the BFSI brands they do business with. Whether it’s adding automation technology with a human touch that can support multiple product types or creating seamless omnichannel experiences, an experienced partner with scale, security, compliance, and digital solutions built in, can ensure optimal digital CX at every interaction. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because ultimately, when customers feel like they are understood, and they can trust us—especially with their finances— their financial institution’s wallet share grows. A strategic CX partner who knows how to deliver people-first, flexible and secure solutions at scale across industries makes all the difference in earning LTV.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",nbsp h5

        ","<p>As companies care more about doing good in the world, they’re selecting partners who share their same passion. International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (<a href=""https://www.iaop.org/"">IAOP</a>) recently launched its long-awaited Social Responsibility in Outsourcing (SRO) Chapter with its inaugural webinar, “The Evolution of Socially Responsible Outsourcing: Relevant Now More Than Ever.” Participating in the webinar, included Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee, along with representatives from other leading organizations including Facebook, Microsoft, Sprint and BSR. &nbsp; </p> <p>For the webinar, Alorica represented service providers in the BPO industry, offering our take on the benefit and impact of a CSR program. Besides the obvious reasons that it’s the right thing to do and our clients care about it, Alorica believes being socially responsible is “<strong>just good business</strong>.” Being in the people-to-people business, our employees are truly our greatest assets, thus we pay attention to what attracts them, motivates them and keeps them. The result? We’ve created a culture of giving back, connection and empowerment through our CSR programs. &nbsp; </p> <p>So how do we do that? One way is through our partnership with <a href=""https://livesbetter.org/"">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a> (MLBA), a global non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of people in need around the world. Alorica employees lead the nearly 100 chapters worldwide, where they are empowered to support individuals, local organizations and communities that matter most to them. In less than four years, MLBA chapters have raised and distributed millions of dollars in grants and disaster relief, and our clients are noticing these efforts! One example is through our partnership with Intuit where we were selected to help with their latest impact sourcing project, establishing a <a href=""https://www.bdtonline.com/news/things-are-falling-into-place-intuit-hiring-going-strong-at/article_0412c28e-c6d7-11e9-b829-b7a2a793f6a2.html"">Prosperity Hub</a> in Bluefield, W. Va. This initiative will bring hundreds of jobs, providing locals with career opportunities and support through MLBA, with the end goal of helping the people there to help themselves and their own community. &nbsp; </p> <p>Interested in learning more about why CSR is important to Alorica?

A major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for Small/Medium Business (SMB) accounts. The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program, and to improve the win-back of members who hadn’t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music. &nbsp; </p> <p><strong>THE PROGRAM</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Phase 1</strong> of the solution involved utilizing Alorica’s data scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring Model), comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling, was thusly launched.</li> <li><strong>Phase 2</strong> implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members.</li> <li><strong>Phase 3</strong> saw Alorica providing full account management of the client’s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client’s profitability. Meanwhile, a sales CRM system and digital sales strategy intelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics. And our CAE came through in the clutch, delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer, resulting in an optimal contact strategy, increased positive customer experiences and higher revenues.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h4>THE RESULTS</h4> <p>The revised Welcome Program increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%. Meanwhile, the win-back program increased usage by 37%, generating a profit of $10 million – 130% of the client’s goal. And to top it off, the full account management and analytical solution improved sales results more than 25% over the control group, and 19% over the client’s internal inside sales team.</p> <p>Turns out, when you don’t do everything by the numbers, you end up with some pretty good numbers.</p> <p><em>Click above to download the full case study.</em></p> &nbsp;",h3winning meant winning backh3 pnbspp pwhen a client was looking to drive more members to its loyalty program they turned to a group that could transform information into insights—and win back their valued customers nbspp pnbspp h4the challengeh4 ul liincrease adoption of their loyalty programli liimprove the winback of members who hadn’t usedli lithe loyalty program for more than six monthsli ul nbsp h4the outcomeh4 ul liincreased loyalty activations by 20 and annual transactions by 17li lithe program generated a profit of 10 million—130 of the client’s goalli lithe full solution improved sales results more than 25 over the control group and 19 over the client’s internal sales teamli ul nbsp h4the clienth4 pso here’s what happened a major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for smallmedium business smb accounts the client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program and to improve the winback of members who hadn’t used the loyalty program for more than six months enter alorica cue the music nbsp p pstrongthe programstrongp ul listrongphase 1strong of the solution involved utilizing alorica’s data scientists from the alorica center of analytical excellence cae to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy a resulting welcome program scoring model comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospectprofiling was thusly launchedli listrongphase 2strong implemented said scoring model built by those alluring data scientists of ours to winback current loyalty program membersli listrongphase 3strong saw alorica providing full account management of the client’s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client’s profitability meanwhile a sales crm system and digital sales strategy intelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics and our cae came through in the clutch delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer resulting in an optimal contact strategy increased positive customer experiences and higher revenuesli ul nbsp h4the resultsh4 pthe revised welcome program increased loyalty activations by 20 and annual transactions by 17 meanwhile the winback program increased usage by 37 generating a profit of 10 million – 130 of the client’s goal and to top it off the full account management and analytical solution improved sales results more than 25 over the control group and 19 over the client’s internal inside sales teamp pturns out when you don’t do everything by the numbers you end up with some pretty good numbersp pemclick above to download the full case studyemp nbsp

Since college, she’s navigated her way through different positions in various industries, gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way. </p><p>Now, as Alorica’s Director of Sales Enablement, she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&amp;A below. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">How did you reach your career goal of becoming a director?</font> <br>After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital part of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn’t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I’d be a great fit. My “stick-to-it-ness” paid off! </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What do you find most rewarding in your role?</font> <br>Seeing my team’s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we’re always working with several different people. Being in this central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation.</p><p><font color=""#98521c"">Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way?</font> <br>I would definitely say (now Alorica’s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly Hanak-Weaver, who I reported to as a proposal manager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team, while empowering them, too. I try to copy off her great leadership style—we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be. </p><p><font color=""#98521c"">What’s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path?</font> <br>At any job, it’s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your career changes, you’ll find that by maintaining a professional network, you’ll always have connections available for referrals, advice and encouragement. <br><font color=""#98521c""><br>Any additional advice for work life?</font> <br>Don’t be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change. And roll with challenging situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long run.</p>",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2e872fbd643474f839af51ddc54483288pngsfvrsnd92daeb010img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2 imgappnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppwith an appreciation for the creativity of writing advertising and graphic design tonya goforth pursued a degree in business management with an emphasis in marketing since college she’s navigated her way through different positions in various industries gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way ppnow as alorica’s director of sales enablement she and her remote team of six help alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations read her full qampa below ppfont color98521chow did you reach your career goal of becoming a directorfont brafter i originally applied for the director position i was disheartened when an external person was hired instead but i knew that i was still a vital part of the team so i continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager later when that director didn’t work out i was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that i’d be a great fit my “sticktoitness” paid off ppfont color98521cwhat do you find most rewarding in your rolefont brseeing my team’s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we’re always working with several different people being in this central position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each wellrounded proposal and presentationppfont color98521cdid you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some wayfont bri would definitely say now alorica’s senior director of product strategy holly hanakweaver who i reported to as a proposal manager she always showed a protectiveness over her team while empowering them too i try to copy off her great leadership style—we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be ppfont color98521cwhat’s the best way to pave a fulfilling career pathfont brat any job it’s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return then as your career changes you’ll find that by maintaining a professional network you’ll always have connections available for referrals advice and encouragement brfont color98521cbrany additional advice for work lifefont brdon’t be intimidated have confidence in yourself and your skills make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change and roll with challenging situations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long runp

Both joined El Paso East as agents and they were equally determined to move up the ranks. As they progressed through their leadership journey, little did they know&nbsp; their Alorica paths were about to come together … </p><p>&nbsp; <b><a href=""/images/default-source/blogs/iamalorica_lori_genet_success.jpg?sfvrsn=3bfb641_0""><img src=""/images/default-source/blogs/iamalorica_lori_genet_success.jpg?sfvrsn=3bfb641_0"" height=""798"" class=""size-full wp-image-16604 alignright"" width=""460"" alt=""IAmAlorica_Lori_Genet""></a></b></p><p><b>Lori’s side of the story.</b><br>“When I was hired in 2014, I set a goal to become an Operations Manager in five years. I was so excited that in just a matter of months, I was offered a Team Manager position!” Lori explained. She was moving on up. &nbsp; </p><p>And … her upcoming vacation was going to be even better knowing she was returning to her new role! She couldn’t wait to get back to work and was eager to meet her new boss. Of course, she was a little nervous because, after all, first impressions are everything! &nbsp; </p><p>When Lori returned to work, she was reassured that her new team had performed well in her absence <i>… because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation to make sure of it. (Uh-oh!)</i></p><p><i></i><b>And now, Genet’s side of the story.</b> <br>It was 2014 and Genet was elated to be offered a promotion from Team Manager to Shift Manager. Her leadership dreams were coming true! Not only was she killing it at work, she also had a vacation planned soon. &nbsp; </p><p>Things were definitely going her way. &nbsp; </p><p>Or so she thought. Genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as Team Manager, Ms. Lori Melendez, had already requested personal time off. Therefore, Genet, as Lori’s new boss, needed to skip her own vacation! &nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, Genet wasn’t thrilled about this change of events. “Who IS this Lori person? She’s taking my team AND my vacation?!” Genet exclaimed. &nbsp; </p><p><b>Unexpected friendships are the best ones.</b> <br>“Genet had to skip her vacation so I could take MINE!” Lori was horrified. This is not the way she wanted to start things off with her new boss! &nbsp; </p><p>Eventually, they were able to laugh about it. And they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually. &nbsp; </p><p>That’s why, a few months later, when Genet received another promotion as Operations Manager for El Paso’s Outbound Team, she immediately invited Lori to be her Team Manager. &nbsp; </p><p>Not only did Genet and Lori successfully lead their team … they were ranked the #1 Outbound Team in Alorica. Because of their <b>passion</b>, <b>performance</b> and belief in limitless <b>possibilities</b>, they were eventually asked to oversee the Inbound Team too. What a major undertaking! &nbsp; </p><p>Now, four years later, Genet and Lori are inseparable. Genet is leading the Inbound Team as Operations Manager. Lori achieved her goal as the Operations Manager of Outbound. And both departments are #1. &nbsp; </p><p>Way to go, Lori and Genet! Thank you for your perseverance and determination and for proving great things can happen when you least expect it. &nbsp; </p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",pa hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsiamaloricalorigenetbannerpngsfvrsn983cfd7d5img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsiamaloricalorigenetbannerpngsfvrsn983cfd7d5 altiamaloricalori classwpimage16596 alignleftappthey’re a friendship made in alorica heaven … but this dynamic duo didn’t exactly start off on the right foot nbsp ppbthe beginningb brbefore genet and lori met each other they were living a parallel course both joined el paso east as agents and they were equally determined to move up the ranks as they progressed through their leadership journey little did they knownbsp their alorica paths were about to come together … ppnbsp ba hrefimagesdefaultsourceblogsiamaloricalorigenetsuccessjpgsfvrsn3bfb6410img srcimagesdefaultsourceblogsiamaloricalorigenetsuccessjpgsfvrsn3bfb6410 height798 classsizefull wpimage16604 alignright width460 altiamaloricalorigenetabppblori’s side of the storybbr“when i was hired in 2014 i set a goal to become an operations manager in five years i was so excited that in just a matter of months i was offered a team manager position” lori explained she was moving on up nbsp ppand … her upcoming vacation was going to be even better knowing she was returning to her new role she couldn’t wait to get back to work and was eager to meet her new boss of course she was a little nervous because after all first impressions are everything nbsp ppwhen lori returned to work she was reassured that her new team had performed well in her absence i… because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation to make sure of it uhohippiiband now genet’s side of the storyb brit was 2014 and genet was elated to be offered a promotion from team manager to shift manager her leadership dreams were coming true not only was she killing it at work she also had a vacation planned soon nbsp ppthings were definitely going her way nbsp ppor so she thought genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as team manager ms lori melendez had already requested personal time off therefore genet as lori’s new boss needed to skip her own vacation nbspppneedless to say genet wasn’t thrilled about this change of events “who is this lori person she’s taking my team and my vacation” genet exclaimed nbsp ppbunexpected friendships are the best onesb br“genet had to skip her vacation so i could take mine” lori was horrified this is not the way she wanted to start things off with her new boss nbsp ppeventually they were able to laugh about it and they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually nbsp ppthat’s why a few months later when genet received another promotion as operations manager for el paso’s outbound team she immediately invited lori to be her team manager nbsp ppnot only did genet and lori successfully lead their team … they were ranked the 1 outbound team in alorica because of their bpassionb bperformanceb and belief in limitless bpossibilitiesb they were eventually asked to oversee the inbound team too what a major undertaking nbsp ppnow four years later genet and lori are inseparable genet is leading the inbound team as operations manager lori achieved her goal as the operations manager of outbound and both departments are 1 nbsp ppway to go lori and genet thank you for your perseverance and determination and for proving great things can happen when you least expect it nbsp pnbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp

        ","<p>Global non-profit <a href=""http://www.livesbetter.org"">Making Lives Better with Alorica</a> (MLBA), announced it has expanded into its sixth country, Guatemala with four chapters – Campus, Primma, Tetra and WTC – at local Alorica contact centers. By expanding into the country, MLBA will positively affect more than 5,000 Alorica employees, their families and local communities. &nbsp; </p> <p>Alorica proudly partners with MLBA to help fulfill its vision of <em>making lives better</em> and continue the culture of paying it forward, a defining characteristic of the company. Elizabeth Dorris, Division Vice President, Guatemala &amp; Honduras says of the expansion, “MLBA offers a unique approach to corporate philanthropy, giving Alorica employees the decision-making power to support local causes and individuals that matter most to them. I’m excited to see how these chapters will support the people of Guatemala.” &nbsp; </p> <p>The news of MLBA’s expansion into <a href=""/insights/resource/meet-alorica-guatemala/"">Guatemala</a> comes on the heels of Alorica celebrating its <a href=""/insights/resource/celebrating-a-decade-spent-making-lives-better-in-guatemala/"">10<sup>th</sup> year in business in the country</a>. Joyce Lee, Alorica’s Chief Culture Officer and President of MLBA, says, “As Alorica celebrates its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in the country, it seemed more than fitting to honor this milestone by expanding MLBA into Guatemala.” Striving to attract and retain the talented people of Guatemala, Alorica has redefined the contact center environment to reflect its people-first culture, offering impactful learning programs to benefits, such as an on-site clinic, free daycare, transportation services and tuition discounts. &nbsp; </p> <p>Since its inception nearly four years ago, employee-led MLBA chapters have raised nearly $4.5 million dollars through Alorica payroll contributions and fundraisers. Of the funds collected, more than 7,750 grants have been awarded – totaling in excess of $3.5 million.&nbsp;In addition, when local areas are hit hard by natural disasters (i.e. hurricane, flooding) or other crises, MLBA assists impacted employees, families and communities through its Disaster Relief Fund. &nbsp; </p> <p>Read more about this expansion on LivesBetter.org.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/Sanjay-Ponnappa-discusses-ESAT-growth-retention,"<p>A company’s performance can’t be driven by simply setting goals or measuring KPIs. It’s leaders who play the most pivotal role in driving an organization’s success because a good leader can be a key reason why an employee joins, stays at or leaves a company. Below are a few strategies that I have found to be vital in establishing a work environment where employees thrive:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5 style=""margin-left: 60px"">1. Cultivate a culture of accountability:</h5><p style=""margin-left: 60px"">Recognizing that mistakes are an inevitable part of the development process fosters a learning-oriented environment rather than one solely focused on results. Encouraging employees to acknowledge their errors and learn from them not only enables them to feel like they can try new or hard things, but also helps boost employee satisfaction and confidence. #BeBold</p><p style=""margin-left: 60px"">&nbsp;</p><h5 style=""margin-left: 60px"">2. Lead by example:</h5><p style=""margin-left: 60px"">By taking the time to walk your employees through your thought process and actions for a project or challenge, they’re able to quickly learn what to do. Especially if it’s their first time, they can benefit from your experience and expertise. It also connects you more to your team, which leads to trust, engagement and high performance. #BeConnected</p><p style=""margin-left: 60px"">&nbsp;</p><h5 style=""margin-left: 60px"">3.

Rita Saavedra Ortiz, Alorica’s Site Director in Kingston, Jamaica, says that she references this Ralph Waldo Emerson quote often: “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” &nbsp; </p><p>Rita’s personal story certainly fulfills that mantra. She started out as an agent in 2004, moved into quality nine months later, and then switched to operations in 2011. Just a handful of months ago, in January 2018, she moved from Panama to Jamaica to take on her newest challenge at the Kingston site. By seizing opportunities as they come, Rita continues to grow and learn in her career, and she inspires others around her to do the same. &nbsp; </p><p>Read her full Q&amp;A below: &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?</b><b><br>A:</b> When I started working in operations seven years ago, I learned the biggest lessons in my career. One of my mentors said, if you fail, just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your comfort zone. So, I started out with a small account, and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it—the exposure with the client, getting into calls with client solutions, making decisions about what is good for the business, and getting to know the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big, new site in Jamaica, I knew I could do it even though it would be new for me. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: What motivates you every day?</b><b><br>A:</b> I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the better you can overcome the roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes, whether good or bad. The fourth one is to get to know your people—not only at the professional level, but at the personal level. Talking to people builds loyalty, and that’s how you get people to not work for you, but to work with you. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: If you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now, what would it be and why?</b><b><br>A:</b> Sometimes I think, what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every decision I’ve made, good or not so good, they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with everything I have accomplished. I wouldn’t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to training, I didn’t want to leave, but it was a good decision. From there, I got to try new things. There’s so many branches in this business. You’d be surprised about what you might succeed in. </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female?</b><b><br>A:</b> I have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I’ve seen many women in this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in a man’s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama, and I was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers. I was able to stand up and lead that task. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Do you think it is important to be a mentor?</b><b><br>A:</b> Right now, my team is spread all over Panama, and I am still mentoring them. When I see my people growing, being insanely great even when we aren’t together, I feel proud of myself. I am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan. You have to have someone else who can take care of your programs, like a mini me. Mentoring is really important.</p>",pa hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2tmb0pngsfvrsna6392a302img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2appa favorite quote can speak volumes about a person’s mindset rita saavedra ortiz alorica’s site director in kingston jamaica says that she references this ralph waldo emerson quote often “do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail” nbsp pprita’s personal story certainly fulfills that mantra she started out as an agent in 2004 moved into quality nine months later and then switched to operations in 2011 just a handful of months ago in january 2018 she moved from panama to jamaica to take on her newest challenge at the kingston site by seizing opportunities as they come rita continues to grow and learn in her career and she inspires others around her to do the same nbsp ppread her full qampa below nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q how has working at alorica specifically led to your personal career growthbbbrab when i started working in operations seven years ago i learned the biggest lessons in my career one of my mentors said if you fail just learn from your mistakes and move forward he said to step out of your comfort zone so i started out with a small account and then i moved to a bigger account i liked it—the exposure with the client getting into calls with client solutions making decisions about what is good for the business and getting to know the financial side when i had the opportunity to work at this big new site in jamaica i knew i could do it even though it would be new for me nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q what motivates you every daybbbrab i have what i call four baselines that i use every day the first one is to be myself the more comfortable you are with yourself the better you can overcome the roadblocks to succeed the second one is always be positive ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things the third one is never be afraid to fail we acquire knowledge from our mistakes whether good or bad the fourth one is to get to know your people—not only at the professional level but at the personal level talking to people builds loyalty and that’s how you get people to not work for you but to work with you nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q if you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now what would it be and whybbbrab sometimes i think what if i did that different those what ifs are part of fear every decision i’ve made good or not so good they got me where i am right now i am satisfied with everything i have accomplished i wouldn’t change anything when i transitioned from quality to training i didn’t want to leave but it was a good decision from there i got to try new things there’s so many branches in this business you’d be surprised about what you might succeed in ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were femalebbbrab i have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock i’ve seen many women in this business doing really great things and having opportunities i always stand up for being a woman in a man’s world i was a volunteer for the red cross in panama and i was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers i was able to stand up and lead that task nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q do you think it is important to be a mentorbbbrab right now my team is spread all over panama and i am still mentoring them when i see my people growing being insanely great even when we aren’t together i feel proud of myself i am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan you have to have someone else who can take care of your programs like a mini me mentoring is really importantp

A typical process will have a management consultant, system expert, or Lean Six Sigma specialist to monitor manual processes for a set time, collect performance data, and make recommendations. Companies supplement this assessment with executive ideation sessions, operational managers’ workshops, and superuser interviews. The traditional way to speed up and improve the accuracy of this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet, despite these efforts, not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and prioritized. &nbsp; </p> <p>In this blog, I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline ‘the discovery stage’ and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4><strong>From manual to automated discovery&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p>Alorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage, calling it ‘One-Click Automation’. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents’ desktop utilization on a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors the users’ screen toggle, clicks, data entries and entry type, and tracks time per system and per screen, the time duration for performing each step, and the number of used fields. It counts errors, frequency, variance in the time and data entry quality, the end-to-end handling time, the complexity, and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the underlying communication between systems and exchanged information. &nbsp; </p> <p>The bot does not capture personal data or other input information, remaining non-invasive to the systems. It also does not intervene with the users’ actions. Once the bot collects enough information (~100k data points per LOB, typically in two weeks), it creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens, the start and end points, the navigation between them, and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product portfolios with multiple support processes (for example, in technical support), Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe. &nbsp;</p> <p>Alorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru, launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results, estimate savings opportunities, and recommend and prioritize bot implementations with workflow business process, exceptions adjudicator, and look-up. Because the collected information shows the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data, the created automation workflows make the bot training quicker and more precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4><strong>Implementations for a healthcare client</strong></h4> <p>For a U.S. healthcare payer client, Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant number of agent desktops for three days, identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with tasks such as secondary claims research, multifactor case, clinical guidelines, and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of agents who performed the particular process, its recurrence, and time taken. The team compared the results to the agent training guidelines, then Alorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement. &nbsp; </p> <p>Alorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client’s voice and non-voice work. For example, in the client’s back-office, the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax. Using third-party RPA &amp; AI partner tools, Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or compliance requirements such as HIPAA. It also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount who translated the data from the claims to the systems. &nbsp; </p> <p>The company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a ‘digital workbench’ for back-office processes, leading with automation. For automation opportunities in voice processes, Alorica is working with several travel, retail, BFSI, media and telecom brands. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4><strong>Automation in the process trenches</strong></h4> <p>The fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume, time-consuming processes, sizable FTE involvement, high error rate, or simply, risk aversion by internal IT teams. To address the latter issue, Alorica automation deployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising, changing or modifying core client systems. The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion with the client’s process owners on the possible cost-benefit and ROI. &nbsp; </p> <p>A less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with dynamic changes of internal rules, product/services, and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will be quite short and its ROI smaller without human supervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the challenge of identifying process impact. To mitigate automation program redesigns, Alorica’s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure with a steady release roadmap. &nbsp; </p> <p>Another challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost optimization and improved performance, Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet, looking to take over higher value processes, and switching to performance-based pricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client, Alorica structured the pricing by processed claim, decreasing the overall cost by ~50%. &nbsp; </p> <br> <h4><strong>The value of partnering for automation</strong></h4> <p>While broad statements for full automation attract media attention, the reality for most companies is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider can deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario, where the vendor has the process and domain expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and supplier network centers to maximize the benefits.</p>",pa hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsights1559057400automationpngsfvrsnd2d29d5e0img

Having the confidence to put yourself out there, whether you have the exact matching skill set or not, is one of the best learning opportunities there is according to Sharon Leal, Alorica’s Director, Operations based in San Antonio, Texas. &nbsp; </p><p>Sharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a “leap of faith” and joined the BPO industry--and she hasn’t looked back since. She’s a huge believer in speaking up, asking questions, and helping others achieve career growth. Read her full Q&amp;A below: &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: How have mentors helped you in your career?</b><b><br>A:</b> I’ve always had great mentors. Early in my career, a mentor told me, “don’t expect what you don’t inspect.” Don’t assume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: “listen to understand.” We sit and we listen, but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and be successful. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Can you share an example of how asking questions helped you to succeed?</b><b><br>A:</b> When I got the call back on my application for this company, I asked to speak to someone who was currently in this position, and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the site director position, I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks. I went through agent training, I took calls, I sat with the QA team, I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be set up for success, to have credibility, and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can’t be afraid to ask, and asking isn’t a weakness. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: Do you think there is still a glass ceiling? Why or why not?</b><b><br>A:</b> I was told at my previous job when I got to a director level that I was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman. I told them I don’t agree, I have worked really hard, I earned this position, and it wasn’t just given to me. I don’t see this at Alorica. Females can underestimate themselves, and sometimes aren’t confident enough to say, “I want to move to the next level.” I’ve never been shy about that. Show your confidence, shake a hand, stand up, and show that you know your business. &nbsp; </p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: What aspects of the company stand out to you as an employee?</b><b><br>A: </b>My goal is to continue to learn everything Alorica has available to us. I’m on the board of directors of MLBA, and I love that we can help employees. I love everything Alorica is doing with social media—that continues to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees. Culture is very important. There are 25 other call centers in San Antonio, but people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy. &nbsp;</p><p><b style=""color: rgba(152, 82, 28, 1)"">Q: How do you inspire others to grow in their careers?</b><b><br>A:</b> When I am mentoring or working with someone, I find out where they want to go and what they need to do that. You’ve got to have goals, work hard, and not wait on opportunities, even if you’re not an exact match. I’ll do a mock interview with you, and I’ll look at your credentials. Sometimes people want a bachelor’s degree—but, well, I don’t have one! But if you have experience and show your results, you may be the most qualified candidate. Don’t be afraid to apply, and learn from the experience. &nbsp;</p>",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2tmb0pngsfvrsna6392a302img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2 imgappnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppwhen faced with a career opportunity is your inclination to go for it or to question your qualifications having the confidence to put yourself out there whether you have the exact matching skill set or not is one of the best learning opportunities there is according to sharon leal alorica’s director operations based in san antonio texas nbsp ppsharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a “leap of faith” and joined the bpo industryand she hasn’t looked back since she’s a huge believer in speaking up asking questions and helping others achieve career growth read her full qampa below nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q how have mentors helped you in your careerbbbrab i’ve always had great mentors early in my career a mentor told me “don’t expect what you don’t inspect” don’t assume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want another mentor gave me the advice “listen to understand” we sit and we listen but do we really understand ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and be successful nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q can you share an example of how asking questions helped you to succeedbbbrab when i got the call back on my application for this company i asked to speak to someone who was currently in this position and i spoke to that person for an hour and a half and when they called me back and offered me the site director position i asked what training they were going to give me they sent me to omaha for 6 weeks i went through agent training i took calls i sat with the qa team i sat with network control and workforce management i wanted to be set up for success to have credibility and relate to the team i was going to manage you can’t be afraid to ask and asking isn’t a weakness nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q do you think there is still a glass ceiling why or why notbbbrab i was told at my previous job when i got to a director level that i was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman i told them i don’t agree i have worked really hard i earned this position and it wasn’t just given to me i don’t see this at alorica females can underestimate themselves and sometimes aren’t confident enough to say “i want to move to the next level” i’ve never been shy about that show your confidence shake a hand stand up and show that you know your business nbsp ppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q what aspects of the company stand out to you as an employeebbbra bmy goal is to continue to learn everything alorica has available to us i’m on the board of directors of mlba and i love that we can help employees i love everything alorica is doing with social media—that continues to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees culture is very important there are 25 other call centers in san antonio but people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy nbspppb stylecolor rgba152 82 28 1q how do you inspire others to grow in their careersbbbrab when i am mentoring or working with someone i find out where they want to go and what they need to do that you’ve got to have goals work hard and not wait on opportunities even if you’re not an exact match i’ll do a mock interview with you and i’ll look at your credentials sometimes people want a bachelor’s degree—but well i don’t have one but if you have experience and show your results you may be the most qualified candidate don’t be afraid to apply and learn from the experience nbspp

            https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-ways-to-turn-your-customers-experience-into-continuous-improvement
        ","<p>The moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or service, is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer support call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>1. Know Your Customer</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Segmentation is powerful.&nbsp; When your customers ask for assistance, it’s important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment. Demographic information goes without saying, but focus should also be given to the&nbsp;<em>type</em>&nbsp;of customer a person is. </p><ul><li>How long have they been a customer?</li><br><li>How many of your products do they own?</li><br><li>How often are they reaching out for support?</li><br><li>What past issues have they needed assistance with?</li></ul><p>Having this insight helps in the way you communicate with the customer later, while also helping you understand how to position self-service and working to find the right solution. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>2. Identify the Problem</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>It may seem simple, but often, companies are not collecting information around&nbsp;<em>why</em> the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue&nbsp;<em>type</em>&nbsp;is critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better self-service content, while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus on driving improvements. In the Forrester article, “<em>Insights-Driven Business Set the Pace for Global Growth”, </em>Forrester references that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with close-looped learning processes.”<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; </p><p>In an era where information changes so rapidly, the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better for the customer, the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their support experience. However, it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to resolve the issue. The more effort required, the more the experience deteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook<em>,&nbsp;<a href=""/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Deflecting Call Volume</a>;&nbsp;</em>resolution is identified as the largest influencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only detrimental to experience scores, but also, they are expensive to support. Therefore, understanding what drives and prevents resolution is a critical component of your contact reduction strategy.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; </p><p>When we think of resolution, we think of it two ways. </p><ul><li><strong>First Contact Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;It’s crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or knowledgebase articles are solving your customer’s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content, potentially reducing support calls and driving improvement in customer support.</li><br><li><strong>Issue Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Issue resolution is a measurement of whether the customer’s issue was resolved. It’s important to understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where you typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred, escalation to a higher level of support, etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved, you will likely see an impact to their overall experience given the delay in resolution. Remember, resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain customer loyalty.</li></ul>&nbsp; <p><strong>4. Build Brand Loyalty</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>One of the best indicators of a customer’s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem will allow you to better understand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. &nbsp;</p><p>Information is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn will set you apart from others in your industry.&nbsp; In a recent blog by COPC, “The Value of Listening: How feedback can be an opportunity to bring brand image to life,” the author mentions that customers are paying more attention to how a brand responds than ever before.<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>As you better understand your customer segment, how often they call, the types of issues that occur for them, what upsets them and the speed with which&nbsp;you can help them, you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar customers. When you listen to your customers and begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner, you reduce the frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your customers. &nbsp; </p><p>Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a support model that simplifies the path to your customers’ resolution is important. As you leverage learnings from your customers’ experiences and incorporate those into your ever-changing support model, you begin to reduce the number of support calls required, the length of the call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of your support model will go down and you will gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their problems. Customers know issues will arise, but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what will set you apart from your competition. &nbsp; </p><p>SOURCES </p><ol><li><a

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/6-reasons-why-millennials-are-better-than-their-stereotype
        ","<p>Shaming our youth is a tradition as old as dirt. In recent history Generation X was known as a group of “Slackers.” Before Gen X, the original “ME” generation was the “Hippies”, the Baby Boomers who are now so worried about these “lazy, entitled, narcissistic” Millennials. &nbsp; </p> <p>You can’t understand anyone accurately when you’re judging them… and that’s exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes. &nbsp; </p> <p>Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO,&nbsp;<a href=""http://achievemulti.wpengine.com/mi/files/2015/08/MIR_KeyTakeaways-2.pdf"">Damar Services</a>&nbsp;said, “I find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have encountered many who are thoughtful, resourceful, open-minded and even visionary community stewards … Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.”<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And for contact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce, Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor market—with 56 million now working.<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Rather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly, get to know them as individuals. You’ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground! &nbsp; </p> <p>You would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly, we haven’t. This is one “way that it’s always been done” that it’s time to let go of, and here are 6 great reasons why. &nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>#1. Data doesn’t tell the whole story</strong></h5> <p>Millennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic, feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind, the reality is that they are not that different from the generations that came before them.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;While the data we read may be statistically accurate, much of it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science—like the reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup Organization—while accurate, doesn’t tell the context of the Millennial experience. &nbsp; </p> <p>Why? Because these surveys don’t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new life stage called “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"">emerging adulthood</a>”. According to Haydn Shaw, generational and cultural differences expert, recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28 is important because, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMrcY9z0nM"">if it’s the Millennials</a>, then it’s a problem that needs to be fixed…if it’s a life stage, it’s a change that we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.” &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>#2. Millennials work to live, not live to work</strong></h5> <p>Millennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives—even above their careers.&nbsp;According to Darlene Corbett, a therapist and success coach, “like many generations before Millennials, marriage and family are part of the big picture for the Millennial population.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>But there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families&nbsp;<strong><em>and</em></strong>&nbsp;fulfill career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for leadership development, they should create a work environment that respects personal values, especially related to family. &nbsp; </p> <p>Find ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to build a great career without damaging their personal relationships. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>#3. Millennials desire personal growth</strong></h5> <p>Work-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the things that matter most to them—such as health, family and leisure time.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Millennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous feedback and coaching and that’s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore, capitalize on the opportunity to mentor them. &nbsp; </p> <p>Gen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY, the purpose behind how work gets done every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them, encourage them, inspire and motivate them, and challenge them to greatness. &nbsp; </p> <p>Companies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise invest in those who need and desperately want to grow? Sounds like a win-win. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>#4.&nbsp;Millennials live their ideals</strong></h5> <p>According to Jean Case, Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation, Millennials invest in the things they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy than in previous years, and put an emphasis on CSR in the workplace.<sup>6</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>A common adage in leadership is to “walk the talk”. Well, Millennials are doing just that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on, or better yet, follow suit. &nbsp; </p> <p>Recognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in organizations. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><strong>#5. Millennials number 73 million&nbsp;</strong></h5> &nbsp; <p>Millennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America’s largest generation in 2019, with 73 million individuals. In fact, as of 2017, Millennials were already the largest population in the workforce—with 56 million working or looking for work. <sup>7</sup></p> <p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p> <h5><strong>#6.&nbsp;Millennials are the future (like it or not)</strong></h5> <p>As Padraig Cotter points out “Millennials are redesigning the future of work. They’re digital natives and it’s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it’s about&nbsp; the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking are crucial, and Millennials can provide this.”<sup>8</sup> &nbsp; </p> <p>Oftentimes, fear holds us back – fear of the unknown, fear of change or just blind fear. But there’s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make their mark on the world. Let’s not succumb to fear and judgment just because we don’t know or understand them. &nbsp; </p> <p>Millennials and contact centers are a perfect match.

https://alorica.com/insights/resource/utility-industry-looks-to-omnichannel-support,"It all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review. Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada, representing more than&nbsp;<a href=""http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/""><strong>39 million residential accounts</strong></a><sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;Of those,&nbsp;<a href=""http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/""><strong>44 percent receive services</strong></a><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;from a retail energy provider (REP), as of year-end 2014. &nbsp; Although the legislative environment is still very much in flux, utility companies increasingly recognize the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product or service, new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the consumer relationship. &nbsp; In this highly controlled industry, demand from utility providers, REPs and consumers to provide more immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction with consumers. Currently, Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to communication—specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues related to service and payments can be conducted.­­ As a result, many companies have moved to un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified operation for three key reasons: <strong>Consistency, Focus on Customer Experience, and Improved Revenue Recovery</strong>. &nbsp; Alorica, a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector, has introduced Financial Care (through its subsidiary, EGS Financial Care, Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the industry that focuses on Care, First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation, who prefer Web-based self-service options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid energy). &nbsp; As they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels, utility regulators and electricity providers should consider the following market trends: &nbsp; <ul> <li><strong>Consumers are increasingly mobile.</strong>Smartphone technology and cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere, anytime – everything from turning devices on and off, to re-programming their thermostat settings, to making a payment. And as technology continues to advance, consumers will look for further innovation from utility providers related to mobile platforms.</li> <li><strong>Consumers want more control over costs.</strong>The idea of prepaid electric service – based on previous consumption rates – has already gained traction with consumers who are now seeing <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/""><strong>energy savings between 5.5 and 14 percent</strong></a><sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;However, this model brings with it new challenges; specifically, protecting customers who may underestimate their usage, particularly because&nbsp;<a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/""><strong>utility companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service</strong></a><sup>4</sup>.</li> <li><strong>Smart meters mean more programs.&nbsp;</strong>Smart meters, which measure energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes, have opened up opportunities for time-based rate programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates,&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.smartgrid.gov/recovery_act/time_based_rate_programs.html"">consumers can benefit</a><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</strong>from the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates.&nbsp;Energy companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings.</li> &nbsp; </ul> New developments in technology, combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices, means that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences, or be left behind with antiquated systems and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly tools, electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further positive change for the industry as a whole. &nbsp; When you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change, many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience, resources and PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions—eliminating significant capital expense, time delay and HR challenges. &nbsp; Through outsourcing, Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience and satisfaction ratings. Talk about a brighter outlook for everyone. &nbsp; <hr> <strong>SOURCES</strong> 1 &nbsp;<a

"https://alorica.com/insights/resource/level-up-gamer-loyalty-in-digital-first-experience-economy
        ","<p>There are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts &amp; online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers, and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns that entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building—and brand loyalty—is customer support, which has taken on greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers. &nbsp; </p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">current gaming boom</a> is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive growth in the past, with <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/the-8-generations-of-video-game-consoles/zvcjkty"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">eight generations of consoles</a> recruiting a whole new crop of hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery ordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a result, a comprehensive player support strategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation. &nbsp; </p> <h4><strong>All-Inclusive Player Support</strong></h4> <p>The gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that took shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service, as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew by the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics, such as account management &amp; payment processing, plus community moderation, knowledge management expansion, live events support, and protecting gamers against fraud. &nbsp; </p> <p>Then there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe, so video game companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every time zone. Even better, support agents should have the regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down, gaming companies need to adopt robust CX services now or risk losing players to the companies that do. &nbsp; </p> <h4><strong>Building Loyalty Outside the Game</strong></h4> <p>Regardless of industry, <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">market data consistently demonstrates</a> that positive customer experiences are a major competitive differentiator. The challenge is that customer experiences in 2021 look a lot different than they did a decade ago. For starters, consumers have dramatically changed the way they communicate with one another. Millennials and Generation Z have jumpstarted this shift. These digital natives <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/summary.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">overwhelmingly prefer</a> to communicate via digital messaging tools as opposed to traditional channels – and this appears to apply whether they are engaging their best friends <a href=""https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/NRF_GenZ%20Brand%20Relationships%20Exec%20Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">or their favorite brands</a>. Overall, the younger generations are more comfortable with digital channels, whether they are powered by humans or bots. &nbsp; </p> <p>It also follows the logic that Generation Z is <a href=""https://www.fox.temple.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AI_chatbot.GBM_.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"">more open</a> to using AI-powered chatbots because they have experience with AI applications from the games they grew up with. Deploying virtual assistants makes it easier for tech-savvy consumers to engage brands while supplying contact centers the extra bandwidth to resolve any number of issues. The point is to give consumers choice. Introducing omnichannel functionality through voice and text-based capabilities enables support teams to meet players through their favorite channels, creating positive impressions in the process. The number one goal of every developer and publisher should be that players are spending their time on game play and not support issues. &nbsp; </p> <h4><strong>Cultivating Trust and Safety</strong></h4> <p>As gaming companies continue to develop multiple revenue streams, the risk and volume of fraud, not to mention account abuse, are sure to increase. The average player today is more likely to engage brands outside the game, whether that’s consuming YouTube reviews, Twitch live streams, podcast recordings, message boards, and the targeted journalism devoted to gaming. The abundance of media today has seeped into the mainstream, exposing players to content that was traditionally only seen or heard by the most serious of fans.

To her, being a mentor is an integral part of her daily life. You know the concept of “paying it forward”? Well, that describes Albertha to the T. &nbsp; </p><p>Even though you could say that <b>Albertha </b>fell into the training and development field, it’s no accident that led her to her current role as <b>VP, Operations Training</b> at Alorica. She’s someone who truly enjoys teaching people and seeing them succeed. &nbsp;<i>Read her full Q&amp;A below:</i></p><p><i></i><font color=""#98521c""><b>Q: What was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your career?</b></font><b><br>A: </b>My strategy has been to always keep in touch with the company’s goals and initiatives. If we’re not aligned, we’re not anything. I learned years ago that the purpose of training is to achieve a business result, and you can only achieve that when you know the goals. I’ve done this throughout my career. &nbsp;</p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Q: Did you ever work with a mentor, and how did that process help you? </b></font><b><br>A:</b> I like to say that I’ve had many mentors, even though they may not have known. If I see someone who has a talent, trait or skill that I admire, I’m going to get to know them. I will insert myself in their space and ask them to teach me. As you supervise people, you should be their teacher and guide. If I know something, I’m going to share it with you and my team. There’s no value in holding back information. The more we all know, the more we can be successful together. &nbsp;</p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? How did you face that challenge?</b></font><b><br>A: </b>As I look at challenges that I’ve had, I try to not look at it from the perspective of, “are you challenging me because I’m a female or a different race?” What I do is if someone is challenging me, or doesn’t want to work with me, I find out why. You’re going to work with all different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things. What are you going to do? You have to work through each issue. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Q: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?</b></font><b><br>A: </b>At Alorica, this Women’s Initiative is very exciting. It’s wonderful that the company has taken this opportunity to say we need to do more, we need to help to educate and grow our female work force. In my area, I find the training field exciting. Even though I fell into this position, it was definitely a great fit for me. It fit my natural tendencies which is to want to see people succeed. In training, you get the satisfaction of seeing someone on the operations floor being successful. I love investing in each person. &nbsp; </p><p><font color=""#98521c""><b>Q: How important is it to have a career plan? How often do you outline your personal career goals?</b></font><b><br>A:</b> I look at where I am, generally in December or January. I’m a linear person, and I do things in a timeline. I look back at the goals I made last year. Did I meet them, how close did I get, and should I realign them? I do checks along the way to make sure I’m on track throughout the year. There are times when life happens, personal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course. Then, you have to look at your original goal and ask if that’s the right one to have. A goal is just that—it’s a point of direction, but you have to be flexible enough to take detours. &nbsp;</p>&nbsp;",pa classalignleft stylefloat left display block width 844px height 112px hrefimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2tmb0pngsfvrsna6392a302img srcimagesdefaultsourceinsightsalor18279aloricaninaction2pngsfvrsna6392a305 stylefloat left classalignnone sizefull wpimage17263 width1500 altaloricaninaction2appnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppnbspppit’s hard not to smile while having a conversation with balbertha turnerb—not only because of her sunny and curious personality but also because she so obviously cares for others to her being a mentor is an integral part of her daily life you know the concept of “paying it forward” well that describes albertha to the t nbsp ppeven though you could say that balbertha bfell into the training and development field it’s no accident that led her to her current role as bvp operations trainingb at alorica she’s someone who truly enjoys teaching people and seeing them succeed nbspiread her full qampa belowippiifont color98521cbq what was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your careerbfontbbra bmy strategy has been to always keep in touch with the company’s goals and initiatives if we’re not aligned we’re not anything i learned years ago that the purpose of training is to achieve a business result and you can only achieve that when you know the goals i’ve done this throughout my career nbspppfont color98521cbq did you ever work with a mentor and how did that process help you bfontbbrab i like to say that i’ve had many mentors even though they may not have known if i see someone who has a talent trait or skill that i admire i’m going to get to know them i will insert myself in their space and ask them to teach me as you supervise people you should be their teacher and guide if i know something i’m going to share it with you and my team there’s no value in holding back information the more we all know the more we can be successful together nbspppfont color98521cbq can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female how did you face that challengebfontbbra bas i look at challenges that i’ve had i try to not look at it from the perspective of “are you challenging me because i’m a female or a different race” what i do is if someone is challenging me or doesn’t want to work with me i find out why you’re going to work with all different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things what are you going to do you have to work through each issue nbsp ppfont color98521cbq how has working at alorica specifically led to your personal career growthbfontbbra bat alorica this women’s initiative is very exciting it’s wonderful that the company has taken this opportunity to say we need to do more we need to help to educate and grow our female work force in my area i find the training field exciting even though i fell into this position it was definitely a great fit for me it fit my natural tendencies which is to want to see people succeed in training you get the satisfaction of seeing someone on the operations floor being successful i love investing in each person nbsp ppfont color98521cbq how important is it to have a career plan how often do you outline your personal career goalsbfontbbrab i look at where i am generally in december or january i’m a linear person and i do things in a timeline i look back at the goals i made last year did i meet them how close did i get and should i realign them i do checks along the way to make sure i’m on track throughout the year there are times when life happens personal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course then you have to look at your original goal and ask if that’s the right one to have a goal is just that—it’s a point of direction but you have to be flexible enough to take detours nbsppnbsp
